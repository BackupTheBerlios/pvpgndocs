- a frustrating night with banner ads. I did get them to work from a new image, but
  not with my background photo. I don't know if it is as simple as the palette?
  I have added to the banner ad doc, but that's all tonight. I need some sleep.

dgwilson65 - 14 Aug 2004
- Still going hard on section 3. I'm running out of expertise. Can you do some Mark? 
- I've seen a separate discussion somewhere about the "storage mode" and I'm still wondering
  if it should be separated from the actual install docs as it's common.
- Updated section 6, now as port number information completed with info c/- an FAQ

dgwilson65 - 15 Aug 2004
- Updates Section 3 - details about many of the conf files, still being worked on.
- Updated section 4. Mark, it needs to be reviewed and updated by you then it can be HTML'd
- Updated section 6 with details of diagnosing Router/Firewall issues. 
- Updated Section 3 - banner ads. Now working! Man I'm glad that's done.
                      I have also added 2 files for inclusion in html on the banner ad subject
                      use 1 or both. They show the smackertools conversion window with the right
                      fields filled in.
