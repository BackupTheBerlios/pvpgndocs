<p><b><a name="whatispvpgn">What is PvPGN?</a></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>PvPGN is software that emulates the Blizzard Battle.net (TM) server. It is a modification 
  of the bnetd server which aims to provide support for all Blizzard clients. 
  It gives you the power to run your own server, manage your own users, 
  run your own tournaments etc. <br>
  <br>
  The PvPGN ( or Player versus Player Gaming Network ) is a bnetd based gaming 
  network server emulation project. It currently supports all Battle.net (TM) clients, 
  such as StarCraft, Diablo II, and Warcraft III. The list of supported clients 
  and their minimum verion required is:<br>
    - Diablo 1 v1.09<br>
    - Starcraft v1.08<br>
    - BroodWar v1.08<br>
    - Warcraft II Battle.net (TM) Edition v2.05<br>
    - Diablo 2 v1.10<br>
    - Diablo 2 LOD v1.10<br>
    - Warcraft III Reign Of Chaos v1.13*<br>
  - Warcraft III Frozen Throne v1.13*</p>
  <p>* PvPGN requires the loader for WarCraft III and it must be used without any CD Cracks or Hacks. There is no loader available for WarCraft on Macintosh.</p>
  <p> A PvPGN Server can be used:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> when wanting to host a local tournament with local users and statistics (lots of internet cafe's do that)</li>
    <li> when wanting to maintain a local community, Battle.net is too big for most of the people; having a local friends community is something better in that case</li>
    <li> for people who want to play LAN but with battle.net-like statistics</li>
    <li> for people who want more features than Battle.net (just look at PvPGN's command set to see how is PvPGN better than Battle.Net)</li>
  </ul>
  <p> It puts you as a &quot;System Administrator&quot; in control.
          Use a PvPGN server to host your own LAN parties or put the server online 
          and on the internet for everyone. You can run Tournaments, have your own 
          local competition ladders. The power is in your hands.<br><br>

<p><b><a name="about">About this guide</a></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    This guide has been created as part of a documentation project for PvPGN. Our intention 
    is to bring together the current knowledge on setting up and running a PvPGN 
    server and to provide details on how the clients can connect.<br>
    <br>
    This documentation project is not a commercial venture, nor has it been done 
    for financial gain (though admitedly that would be nice). It has been put 
    together by volunteers who are just trying to &quot;do their bit&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    Q. Can you help?<br>
    A. Yes - read this guide<br>
    <br>
    If you have encountering an administration issue or your clients are having 
    operational issues then see if that scenario has been covered in this guide. 
    If after doing this you still doing have a working solution, then post a 
    message to the pvpgn forums at http://forums.pvpgn.org<br>
    <br>
    If a resolution for your issue has been found, we would appreciate your help 
    by documenting the issue and the resolution so that this guide can be updated. 
    Usually the message forum text can be used with some editing, we'd appreciate 
    you doing this. Don't worry, we'll fix up any bad english or speeling erros.<br>
    <br>
    Our intention has been to write this guide relative to PvPGN 1.7, if you have 
    an earlier release then your question may be answered here. We of course would 
    prefer that you updated your copy of the software to the latest release.<br>
    <br>
    Finally a big thank you to the PvPGN developers and you our supporters.</p>

<br>
Clearly x86 is the most tested version. The platforms/operating systems not 
  listed have not been tested or they did not come to the developers attention 
  however, any POSIX system should work.</p>
  <p> If you have an operating PvPGN server on a platform/OS not listed above then 
  please report it to the developers via the forums at <a href="http://forums.pvpgn.org">http://forums.pvpgn.org</a>

  <p>
    It is a good idea to provide revalant information for your question like 
  the following:<br>
  <br>
  1. Where is the PvPGN server, internal LAN?<br>
  2. How many players on internal LAN?<br>
  3. How many players on external LAN?<br>
  4. Details from the revalent configuration file (not the whole file)<br>
  5. Short extracts from the bnetd.log file<br>
  6. Software versions that are being used, both server and clients</p>
