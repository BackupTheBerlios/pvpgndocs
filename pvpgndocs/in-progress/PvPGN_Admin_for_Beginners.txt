Note: A significant documentation effort is currently underway for PvPGN. This how-to will
be superseeded by that documentation. Some of the output from the project is already
starting to appear at http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=53514 please visit.

#--------------------


Many thanks to the dedicated programmers and team that are part of the PvPGN for their support
and ongoing committment to the support of the project. The team at http://forums.pvpgn.org have
been wonderful and an "oracle" for information.

I guess I've come along relatively late in the piece. The server version is now at 1.6.3 and 
I've had a relatively bug free run with things. I wanted to write this documentation as a 
contribution to the development effort such that others would be able to learn and utilise 
the information to "get past the dumb questions".

Note: My experiences are based on the Windows version and as such should be able to be adapted to
any of the product variants.

Some of the questions and answers have been lifted directly from the FAQ section at
http://forums.pvpgn.org I have done this to consolidate the questions/answers into 
one archive and because the questions relate to StarCraft or Windows or a relevant 
to other content in this How-To.

1.  What do I need to be familiar with? Where are the tools?
2.  How do I download new mpq files
3.  What files in the "Conf" directory need to be maintained?
4.  What if I want to compile this thing?
5.  Installation decisions - files, cdb, mysql?
6.  More help and FAQ's
7.  How do I access my PvPGN server with StarCraft?
8.  How do I use the CDB_Tool for editing a user file?
9.  How can I have more than one SC/BW client behind a router?
10. Can I edit a source file and compile so I can play Fastest 
    Speed on Ladder on my server? 
11. Not able to play ladder on "Fastest" speed? Can't find the 1.11b hack?
12. Cannot find any games?
13. MySQL Cross Platform Compatabilty, Mac OS X to Windows DB's?
14. How do I connect to my server with WarCraft III?
15. Loosing Battle.net preferences for Mac OS 9?
16. How do I Help out on the PvPGN development?
17. How do I setup my own banner adverts?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. What do I need to be familiar with? Where are the tools?
  - bnftp.exe - you need this for downloading "*.mpq" files from blizzard. The mpq files are used
                as part of the autoupdate machanism of the PvPGN server.
              - the software version should match that of the PvPGN server (i.e. 1.6.3)
              - I created my version by downloading the product source from sourceforge and
                compiling the product. The bnftp.exe software was in the bin directory of the source.
                
2. How do I download new mpq files
  - you need a current version of the bnftp software, see elsewhere in this how-to on how to obtain it.
  - below is real command line entries that can be put into a windows batch file if required. Note that
    bnftp.exe must be in your PATH.
    
    bnftp --client=SEXP --arch=IX86 --file=SEXP_IX86_1xx_111B.mpq useast.battle.net 6112
    bnftp --client=STAR --arch=IX86 --file=STAR_IX86_1xx_111B.mpq useast.battle.net 6112
    bnftp --client=SEXP --arch=XMAC --file=SEXP_XMAC_1xx_111B.mpq useast.battle.net 6112
    bnftp --client=STAR --arch=XMAC --file=STAR_XMAC_1xx_111B.mpq useast.battle.net 6112 
    bnftp --client=SEXP --arch=PMAC --file=SEXP_PMAC_1xx_111B.mpq useast.battle.net 6112
    bnftp --client=STAR --arch=PMAC --file=STAR_PMAC_1xx_111B.mpq useast.battle.net 6112
    
    bnftp --client=W3XP --arch=IX86 --file=W3XP_IX86_1xx_116A_enUS.mpq useast.battle.net 6112   --REM 23MB
    bnftp --client=WAR3 --arch=IX86 --file=WAR3_IX86_1xx_116A_enUS.mpq useast.battle.net 6112   --REM 15MB
    bnftp --client=W3XP --arch=XMAC --file=W3XP_XMAC_1xx_116A_enUS.mpq useast.battle.net 6112   --REM 25MB
    bnftp --client=WAR3 --arch=XMAC --file=WAR3_XMAC_1xx_116A_enUS.mpq useast.battle.net 6112   --REM 19MB
    bnftp --client=W3XP --arch=PMAC --file=W3XP_PMAC_1xx_116A_enUS.mpq useast.battle.net 6112   --REM doesn't exist
    bnftp --client=WAR3 --arch=PMAC --file=WAR3_PMAC_1xx_116A_enUS.mpq useast.battle.net 6112   --REM doesn't exist
    
    or
    
    bnftp --client=W3XP --arch=IX86 --file=W3XP_IX86_115A_116A_enUS.mpq useast.battle.net 6112 --REM 216K
    bnftp --client=WAR3 --arch=IX86 --file=WAR3_IX86_115A_116A_enUS.mpq useast.battle.net 6112 --REM 277k
    bnftp --client=W3XP --arch=XMAC --file=W3XP_XMAC_115A_116A_enUS.mpq useast.battle.net 6112 --REM 770K
    bnftp --client=WAR3 --arch=XMAC --file=WAR3_XMAC_115A_116A_enUS.mpq useast.battle.net 6112 --REM 831k
    bnftp --client=W3XP --arch=PMAC --file=W3XP_PMAC_115A_116A_enUS.mpq useast.battle.net 6112 --REM doesn't exist
    bnftp --client=WAR3 --arch=PMAC --file=WAR3_PMAC_115A_116A_enUS.mpq useast.battle.net 6112 --REM doesn't exist
    

    The resulting output files "*.mpq" need to be moved to the "Files" directory of the PvPGN server.

3. What files in the "Conf" directory need to be maintained?
  - versioncheck.txt
  - autoupdate.txt
  - gametrans.conf
  
  - Warning. Incorrect maintenance of version for connecting gamers can cause problems on the server 
    that are difficult to explain and lead you right up the garden path. For instance someone trying 
    to join a game running version B of the software will not see any games listed if all the other 
    players on the server are running version C.
    
  - versioncheck.txt
    This file lives in your "conf" directory. If maintained properly it will list every client version 
    of software produced, product by product, version by version. I believe that updated version of this 
    file are distributed with new server releases and updates posted to http://forums.pvpgn.org though you 
    need to copy and paste in the entries yourself.
    Creating your own entries is very easy, just think about what you are doing.
    a. backup your existing versioncheck.txt file.
    b. connect to your server with the new or updated client software
    c. capture the entries from the bnetd.log file (these have all the information you need)
    
    thus...
    Jun 13 11:01:25 [info ] _client_authreq109: [220] CLIENT_AUTHREQ_109 ticks=0x4805126a, verstr=1.1.1.3 exeinfo="starcraft.exe 05/26/04 00:46:00 1048576" versionid=0x000000c9 gameversion=0x01010103 checksum=0xe6380bff

    1.1.1.3 \
    0xe6380bff \
    SEXP_111B
    
  - autoupdate.txt
    This file along with the correct setting in bnetd.conf give you as server administrator 
    to enforce that only up-todate client can play on your server.
    So assuming I've got things right so far (and I have tested this for Mac OS X and PC) 
    the autoupdate.txt file needs to contain the following lines. This caters for upgrades 
    from v1.10 to 1.11b and from 1.11 to 1.11b...

  - gametrans.conf
    I'm not going to pretend to know anything much here. On http://forums.pvpgn.org
    in the Official Tech Support forum, there is an in-depth article posted by 
    Daytranno. READ IT.
    
    What I will put here is one of my replies to a message on the forums.
    
    http://forums.pvpgn.org/index.php?showtopic=77 (link to in-depth article)

    This is an indepth review of how the gametrans file works. It's a supporting 
    file in your "conf" directory. The problem is basically that your external user 
    needs to communicate with you 192.168.x.x and is unable to do so. All of your 
    internal IP addresses need to be mapped externally to your external ip address 
    and different ports. You also need to open these ports on your firewall and 
    route the ports to the specific ip addresses.

    So, currently the plumbing can't get to where it needs to go. When you first 
    meet on the server, the server handles the communication. When the game starts, 
    communication responsibility is passed to the "game" or each machine.

    Here's an extract from my gametrans.conf file (currently commented out)
    
    # Firewall rules have been modified to route TCP and UDP traffic of the external ports
    # direct to the specified machine.
    :      192.168.10.200:6112      <external_ip>:16200       192.168.10.0/24
    :      192.168.10.199:6112      <external_ip>:16199       192.168.10.0/24
    :      192.168.10.197:6112      <external_ip>:16197       192.168.10.0/24
    :      192.168.10.195:6112      <external_ip>:16195       192.168.10.0/24
    :      192.168.10.193:6112      <external_ip>:16193       192.168.10.0/24
    :      192.168.10.189:6112      <external_ip>:16189       192.168.10.0/24
    :      192.168.10.106:6112      <external_ip>:16106       192.168.10.0/24

    
    Note: as of PvPGN 1.6.3, it is my belief that the gametrans file does not _fully_ work
          for StarCraft/Broodwar. You can test this by starting a game on the same LAN
          as your PvPGN server and getting an external user to connect. If your Gametrans.conf
          file and firewall rules are setup correctly, it should work. (full speed).
          Repeat this test using another computer on your internal LAN (not the PvPGN server).
          Next try running two computers on your internal LAN and one external user.
          Game speeed should drop and become unplayable.
          --> I'm guessing, but the external user has been told how to communicate with
              the game host (i.e. the machine that initiated the game). The external
              user DOES NOT know how to communicate with the other LAN user.
              
    VPN
    ===
    I have a friend connecting through via VPN (firewall - to - firewall) and all 
    hell breaks loose when he connects, and we have an external player too. 
    i.e. it doesn't work. I haven't completed the analysis on what to do to the 
    gametrans.conf file in this situation. His internal network is 10.1.1.*

    I believe that after you change this file, you will have to restart your server.
    When you've made this change and people connect, watch what happens in the bnetd.log file. 
    It is your primary source of information to tell you what is happening!
    
4. What if I want to compile this thing?
   Prepare to be shocked and amazed....
   a. download the source from sourceforge.net
   b. decompress the file into a directory on your machine
   c. READ and I mean READ the file 
       docs\Compile.Instructions.Win32.Borland.txt
       - yes I am assuming you are on Windows and don't have .NET compiler at hand
       - The instructions tell you that a FREE compiler is available from 
         ftp://ftpd.borland.com/download/bcppbuilder/freecommandLinetools.exe
       - Just read the rest of the instructions and follower the compiler install
         instruction to the letter. It's not complicated.
       - Once installed do a test compile (without changes). This will confirm your installation.
       
5. Installation decisions - files, cdb, mysql?
   As I recall the installation on windows prompts you for how you want to handle your data files.
   Somehow I ended up running with CDB. This wasn't really a problem until I wanted to edit some
   attributes of my users. I though that the user files were just text. I was WRONG.
   
   bnetd.conf has quite a bit of self documentation about altering the server configuration
   to support files, cdb, or mysql. I guess that larger installations would be wise to run 
   with a mysql database for performance, while at the low end of the scale, "files" will
   work but performance wont be the best.
   
   I switched to files so that I could edit the user files. Hey, I was trying to get ladder
   games to work (turned out to be a server bug / client version issue), and get "real"
   administrator access to the server.
   
   - cbd - editing user data
     Stored in var/userscdb
     The windows version ships with a program called cbd_tool.exe You can use this to 
     edit your user files if you have the need.
     
   - files - editing user data
     Stored in var/users
     No special tools required, a text editor is brilliant.
     
   - What does the contents of a user file look like?
     "Record\\SEXP\\0\\last game result"="DRAW"
     "profile\\location"="GRAGAH"
     "BNET\\acct\\lastlogin_ip"="192.168.10.193"
     "Record\\SEXP\\0\\draws"="28"
     "Record\\SEXP\\0\\last game"="29643220 212508874"
     "BNET\\acct\\lastlogin_clienttag"="SEXP"
     "BNET\\acct\\lastlogin_owner"="Grant"
     "BNET\\acct\\passhash1"="[removed]"
     "BNET\\acct\\username"="Grant"
     "BNET\\acct\\lastlogin_time"="1087187841"
     "Record\\SEXP\\0\\losses"="7"
     "Record\\SEXP\\0\\wins"="14"
     "Record\\SEXP\\1\\rank"="2"
     "Record\\SEXP\\1\\high rating"="1000"
     "Record\\SEXP\\1\\rating"="975"
     "BNET\\acct\\userid"="3"
     "Record\\SEXP\\1\\last game result"="LOSS"
     "Record\\SEXP\\1\\high rank"="2"
     "Record\\SEXP\\1\\losses"="1"
     "Record\\SEXP\\1\\last game"="29642988 164423556"

   - The default user file - but wait there's more
     Take a look in the conf directory. There are 2 default user files.
     I believe that only one is used based on your setup in bnetd.conf
     I have no idea how this works for mysql.
     
     bnetd_default_user.cdb - you can't view this with a text editor
     bnetd_default_user.txt - view with a text editor
     
     Using bnetd_default_user.txt as an example, if a value is set in this file
     the same value does not need to be set in the users actual data file.
     
     So if you want o make everyone admins ahve have access to ALL server commands
     ensure that these lines are uncommented.
     "BNET\\auth\\admin"="true"
     "BNET\\auth\\command_groups"="255"
     Don't leave things like this unless you TRUST everyone. Have these lines
     only in the user files of the real admins.
     
6. More help and FAQ's
     There's a FAQ at http://pvpgn.ez15loan.com/
     There is a detailed FAQ at http://www.world-of-amadeus.de
     This site also has details about PvPGN and mysql
     
     Now, I'm going to repeat part of that FAQ here only because it was the first
     thing that I tried to get done when I fired up the server, and I got nailed
     on the forums because the subject had been covered and covered before (not that
     I could find :-)  )
     
     > How do I give my account administrative privileges & what does this mean?
     
     In short, this means a user with administrative privileges can ban other players 
     or delete their accounts within the Battle.net console. Users with administrative 
     privileges are indicated differently depending on what game you are playing. 
     For example, in Starcraft, their would be a small Blizzard logo by their name. 
     In Diablo II, their text color is generally blue while everyone else's is white & 
     their character will say "Blizzard Rep" when you place your mouse cursor over it. 

     The following only needs to be done to create the first administrative user. 
     Once that user has administrative privileges, they can give other players the 
     same privileges, should he or she wish to, within the Battle.net console. 
     If you already have a user with administrative privileges & want to give 
     another user the same privileges, skip to step 3 for further information. 
     If you installed PvPGN without MySQL support, it means you are using the 
     flat files to store players account information & stats. The user accounts are 
     typically named by the users name. The PVPGN database is not located here. 

     If you installed PvPGN without MySQL support: 

     1. Shutdown PvPGN. 
     2. Find the name of the user you want to give administrative privileges in the 
        path where you installed PvPGN, under the var/users sub-directory. 
     3. Edit the file in a text editor & add the following lines to the beginning 
        of the user account file. Make sure they are the first lines in user account 
        files or it wont work: 

        "BNET\\auth\\admin"="true" 
        "BNET\\auth\\command_groups"="255" 
        "BNET\\auth\\operator"="true" 

     4. Save & close your text editor. 
     5 Start PvPGN. 

     If you installed PvPGN with MySQL support: 

     1. Shutdown PvPGN. 
     2. Edit the PVPGN database. phpMyAdmin is a good program to use to edit MySQL databases. 
     3. Go to the BNET table in the database. 
     4. Find the user account you want to give administrative privileges. 
     5. Change the auth column from false to true. 
     6. Apply the changes. 
     7. Start PvPGN. 

     Now that you have at least one user with administrative privileges, log in as that user 
     & type the following to give administrative privileges to another user. Only give this 
     privilege to users you trust. This privilege is NOT meant for everybody, just those 
     that run or manage your PvPGN server. All users are NOT given administrative privileges 
     by default: 

     /makeadmin jack 
     This example would give the user jack administrative privileges. 

     To remove administrative privileges, at the console type: 
     /demoteadmin jack 
     This example would remove the user jack administrative privileges. 

     This works instantly when PvPGN is setup using MySQL. If your running in file mode, 
     PvPGN will need to be restarted for the changes to take effect. 

     --Extra Help Here!
     To give access to all of the command groups, logon as the "admin" user and type:
     /set jack BNET\auth\command_groups 255
     This example will give user jack access to all commands on the server.
     Type /set on its own to confirm the syntax.

7. How do I access my PvPGN server with StarCraft?
   - bnetconfig.exe (win32)
   - bnetse.dmg (Mac OS 10.3 image file)
     http://pvpgn.cyfx.net/files/MacBNetGatewayEditor-v0.3.dmg
     Note: I think version 0.2 worked under 10.2, but required some fiddling with resedit.

     Also, check out this site for additional PvPGN materials. http://pvpgn.cyfx.net/
   These programs allow you to edit the battle.net preferences files to provide additional servers
   i.e. your PvPGN server.
   
   Special notes for MAC users! - I needed these steps for Mac OS X 10.2. 
   May not be required for new software.
   StarCraft version was 1.10 at the time I believe.
   
   a. Run the Battle.net Server Editor program
   b. Add in your server, name, ipaddress, zone (actually timezone referenced to GMT)
   c. Save changes....  The file you have just updated is "<user>/Library/Preferences/Starcraft prefs"
   d. Backup this file
   e. Backup "battle.net Preferences" in the same folder
   f. Find ResEdit, run it
   g. Open both files
   h. In the Starcraft prefs file, copy the following resource 
      HKEY_CURRENT_USER/software/battle.net/configuration/battle.net gateways
   i. Paste this resource into the Battle.net preferences file (replacing the one currently there!!!)
   j Run StarCraft, connect to battle.net server

8. How do I use the CDB_Tool for editing a user file?
   The detail for this question has been taken directly from the FAQ section at http://forums.pvpgn.org
   Answer c/- aaron
   
   a. copy the account file you want to edit into another folder
   b. cdb -d cdbaccountfile > tempfile
   c. edit tempfile and add the line:
   d. +24,3:BNET\auth\command_groups->255
   e. cdb -c cdbaccountfilenew tempfile
   f. now overwrite your old cdbaccountfile with the cdbaccountfilenew

9. How can I have more than one SC/BW client behind a router?
   The detail for this question has been taken directly from the FAQ section at http://forums.pvpgn.org
   Answer c/- aaron
   
   When you wanna play SC/BW games with more than one user behind the same router.. it won't work....
   here is the solution... 
   for each gaming PC behind the router do this:

   a. use regedit to edit/create:
      HKLM\Software\Battle.net\Configuration REG_DWORD "Game Data Port"
      (choose a unique so far unused port for each client)
   b. Then on your router forward each of those ports to the correct client computer... 
      (UDP, not sure if TCP needed)

10. Can I edit a source file and compile so I can play Fastest Speed on Ladder on my server? 
   
   Quite possibly, see #11 below.   

   The maximum ladder speed is tied up with the client (i.e. your machine) 
   and Starcraft ruinning on it. In other words it's coded in Starcraft and 
   is difficult to influence at the server end.

   c/- http://forums.pvpng.org Comments and Suggestions, v1.7 Feature Requests 
   Response c/- dizzy
   I dont think this is server side setting. the client hardcodes the speed 
   of the ladder games AFAIK

11. Not able to play ladder on "Fastest" speed? Can't find the 1.11b hack? 
    No problem, fix it server side.

    It's not a ladder game, but you can play One on One games and the results
    count towards the ladder.
    
    PitchWhite posted this patch on Jun 22 2004. It has been successfully applied
    again PvPGN 1.6.3
    
    
    Open... 

    /src/bnetd/game.c

    Find...

    CODE  
        if (realcount>=1 && !game->bad)
        {
           if (game_get_type(game)==game_type_ladder ||
               game_get_type(game)==game_type_ironman)
               {
                t_ladder_id id;
    
           if (game_get_type(game)==game_type_ladder)
               id = ladder_id_normal;
           else
               id = ladder_id_ironman; 

    Replace with

    CODE  
        if (realcount>=1 && !game->bad)
        {
           if (game_get_type(game)==game_type_ladder ||
               game_get_type(game)==game_type_ironman ||
               game_get_type(game)==game_type_oneonone)
              {
               t_ladder_id id;
    
           if (game_get_type(game)==game_type_ladder || 
               game_get_type(game)==game_type_oneonone)
                id = ladder_id_normal;
           else
                id = ladder_id_ironman; 

    Basically, One on One Gametypes now count as ladder. Do not worry about 
    computers, though, either. The server is programmed to give an error for 
    a game if there is no loser, which there wouldn't be in a 1v1 PvC game. 
    So no ladder points are recieved, nor is the game counted.

    Enjoy! 


12. Cannot find any games?
    This is a reoccurring theme in the forums at http://forums.pvpgn.org 
    You need to fix this error yourself with some careful analysis and updating.
    Also refer to question 3 above.

    First, ask some questions:
    Do you know specifically what version of the software you are using?
    Do you know specifically what version of the software your fellow game 
    players are using?

    My StarCraft experiences with PvPGN show that if the "GAME VERSION TAG"
    is not identical for all players then you can't see one anothers games. 
    (I'm sure it's versiontag).

    Depending on how the server is setup, it may or may not check versiontags. 
    Even if it is setup, but the admin running the PvPGN server has not 
    maintained the versioncheck.txt file then it is possible for you to connect 
    to the server and get a version tag that doesn't match everyone elses.

    OK, so you can't play on battlenet because of lag. I recommend you connect 
    to battle.net to at least verify that you are using the most up-to-date 
    version of the client software.

    If problems persist your PvPGN admin needs to update his versioncheck.txt file.

    examples... there are 4 x examples below, the last line is the versiontag 
    that is used inside the server. So you can connect and play with different 
    versions, but you must use matching software version to play games.

    It is posisble to cheat the system (under certain circumstances) and to 
    do that you must know the name of a game that has been created and key it 
    on your secrren (true for starcraft at least). Though it may not work in 
    all circumstances or for WarCraft.

13. MySQL Cross Platform Compatabilty, Mac OS X to Windows DB's?
    - text and reply extracted from forum post.

    POST - Gambit642
    My Mac (G3 900mhz; 40GB HD 7200; 1GB PC100 Memory) kills my
    PC (Intel 3.2Ghz Extreme Ed. 2MB Cache; 40GB 7200GB; 1GB DDR PC4200)
    in PvPGN performance and server-end response time. There are also security 
    conserns when the server goes public, so I want to make it Mac.

    So I want to host as many services as I can on the Mac. Can the DB's directory 
    in MySQL for OS X be copied over to the Windows MySQL directory and work? 
    What about the other way? Can PvPGN be hosted on a Mac and connect to MySQL on 
    a WinXP box?

    REPLY - U-238
    My recommendation would to be to have PvPGN and MySQL both running on the Mac. 

    Download MySQL for Mac here:
    http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-4.0/mysql-standard-4.0.20-apple-darwin7.3.0-powerpc.dmg/from/pick

    There is an excellent Mac-MySQL How-to here:
    http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2002/03/08/apache_mac_5.html

    And you can download PvPGN /w MySQL support for Mac here:
    http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pvpgn/pvpgn-1.6.3-1mysql.macos.ppc32.dmg?download

    Good luck, and finally there will be more than 2 Mac servers on the tracker     
    

14. How do I connect to my server with WarCraft III?

    You need a "loader and gateway editor".
    
    http://pvpgn-files.ath.cx/Warcraft III Roc & FT PvPGN Loader by Acid!.zip
    and a Battle.net Gateway editor
    http://pvpgn-files.ath.cx/BNGatewayEditor.exe
    --> look here for other things too... http://pvpgn-files.ath.cx

    1. Update to the latest version of Warcraft III. The latest update patch can 
       be obtained from Blizzards website. 

    2. Run the Battle.net gateway editor, make sure you select the WarCraft tab at
       at the bottom of the window, add the server you wish to connect to. Make it
       the default server if you wish.
       
    3. Download and install the WarCraft III loader simply copy the 2 files (exe and dll)
       to your Program Files folder, and run the exe.
       
    <these instructions may be a bit short. ifyou have a better set, I'd be happy to update>

15. Loosing Battle.net preferences for Mac OS 9?

    > It seems that the new StarCraft v1.11b checks if the file "Battle.net Preferences" 
    > was edited by someone else. Everytime I startup StarCraft, it resets my newly added Gateways.    
    
    Is this you? Well some analysis by "Cassiel" came up with this answer...
    
    I tested this on a German Mac OS X 10.3.4 with an US-Version of Starcraft: BroodWar 
    and applied Patch 1.11b.

    It seems that StarCraft only resets this file if the length of the resource where the 
    Gateways are store is bigger than 125. All entries below this length are working 
    perfectly. It also happens if you try to add a new gateway.

    I locked the resource entry through Resorcerer and it worked, but after a new restart 
    of Stacraft the program also writes the gateways to the file "Starcraft preferences", 
    now I have two gateway resource-entries, one in "Battle.net preferences" and the other 
    one in "Starcraft preferences". If these gateways differs, Starcraft is loads up the 
    default hard-coded settings somewhere in the program. It also uses the default gateways 
    if you change the permission on this file to "read only". Strange thing!
    
    > The solution?
    
    Why not delete the gateways you do not intend to use and add in the gateway you want 
    to use. This will keep you entries <125 (bytes?)
    
16. How do I Help out on the PvPGN development?

    This section is more for my random collection of notes at this point.
    We'll see how it evolves.
    
    dizzy: README.DEV document if you go on the pvpgn development road
    
    The "latest" source code is available at:
    dizzy: If you do development you need to do it on current CVS (ie 1.7) not on 1.6 
    releases. for that you need to fetch the latest CVS 
    from sf.net: :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/pvpgn
    
    If you're new to this, search http://sourceforge.net for stuff about "CVS"
    and if you're on windows, look for a program called "wincvs". It's not the only
    CVS program for windows, I've provided the name here as a pointer for you.
    Sourceforge has a good write up about CVS and there are free PDF books available
    on the subject too.
    
    dizzy: If you want to contribute code back to the forums, please give use unified 
    diffs against latest CVS not whole files or part of files (its easier to 
    read them, check them, commit them). To get such a diff do something like this:
    cvs diff -u > /path/to/patchfile

    If you are in the root source directory of a checked out CVS source tree 
    it should output a unified diff into patchfile file.

    And your output looks like the file below c/- wincvs using the 
    Query/Diff selection menu option... (this shows code that I have added
    and is not in the current Sourceforge version)

17. How do I setup my own banner adverts?

	Banners are the long, narrow rectangular graphics displayed at the top of the 
	client screen. They may be animated or static pictures. The real Battle.net 
	uses the for commercial advertisements, but you can use them for server logos, 
	team logos, etc. 

	To create your own advertisements you'll need to do some preparation and 
	quite possibly much experimentation and that's just to create the graphics.
	I urge you to test the final results on all flavours of client software and 
	hardware that might connect to your server. What displays on one configuration
	may not display on another.

	Graphic Formats:
	----------------
    The formats that are supported are PCX, MNG, and SMK.  These are the only
    known formats that are supported by the Blizzard clients. For animated
    banners, you must use the SMK (Smacker) format or MNG format. The actual 
    size of the images must be 468x60 pixels in 256 indexed color mode.

       "*.mng" only works for Warcraft III
       "*.pcx" only works for Starcraft, both on Mac and PC
       "*.smk" is probably the best format as it will work for all clients.

    There is however a catch, there's always a catch. PvPGN does not ship with 
    "*.pcx" files. "*.smk" files are considered to be better than the other 
    formats by the developers and supported by all clients. They don't 
    have palette limitations and they compress better. And just to add to
    the effort required here, no normal graphics program can produce a "*.smk" file.

    So for example a "*.pcx" banner displayed in StarCraft will look like a
    random selection of colours unless you restrict your colour selection to
    64 colours starting at colour number 32.

    So your best output format is "*.smk" but how do you produce it?
    You need "SmackerTooks". 
      - It's free! (Phew!)    
      - It only runs on Windows (ugg!)    
    SmackerTools comes from http://www.radgametools.com - download it at:
    http://www.radgametools.com/down/Smacker/SmkTools.exe

    SmackerTools can take many different filetypes as input. Try it and see 
    what works best for you. It definately takes Photoshop files from a Mac.

    There is however a trick to getting this to work. Remember we needed to
    restrict the output to 64 colours. Well give Smackertools your full 
    unrestricted Photoshop file (or gif, or Paintshop Pro). Then on the
    conversion screen we'll tell Smackertools what to do.

    * as a side note, have a read of the SmackerTools FAQ on their web site.        

    From the main screen of the RAD Video Tools, highlight the animation that 
    you want to convert, and click the "SmackIt" button at the bottom of the 
    window. Once the RAD Compressor window opens, you'll be able to tell
    SmackerTools what colour range to use. Enter 64 in the "To Use:" field of
    the Palette area on the screen, enter 32 in the "To begin at:" field. Click
    the Smack button to convert your graphic. 

    You have the option of converting a single image into a single converted file or
    converting multiple files into a single smacker file. I'll leave you to
    figure out how to do that.
    
    Also sound encoding is possible with the SMK format. As to if the clients
    will play the sound, well you experiment and tell us.

    // * Under Linux, you may create the PCX files with The Gimp. To view SMK
    // * files, you may use WINE to run the SMACKPLW.EXE program from the RAD
    // * tools. I know it works with version 20000614 with no Windows registry
    // * or DLLs. I have not tried to use the authoring tools under WINE.
     
    // * If you know of tools that can handle these formats under Linux or MacOS
    // * let us know and we will add them to the list here.


	Preparation:
	------------ 
    a. Graphical editor, "Paint Shop Pro", "Photoshop", almost anything.
       I have used Paint Shop Pro (http://www.jasc.com/index.html) for editing
       PCX files. It has excellent support for manipulating color pallets
       (save, load, etc) on Windows.
       
       Mac users can use Graphic Converter. 

       Jasc Paint Shop Pro 8 also includes an Animation Editor. You access it from
       the File / Jasac Software Products menu. Select Jasac Anamination Shop.
       With this program you can create mng files from just about any source. 

       This is quite possibly ideal for WarCraft and all that you need to do.
       U-238 says "For .mng, just make a .png and rename the file extention"
       I understand that "mng" is "multiple png".

          reference http://www.libpng.org/pub/mng/mngaped.html
       
    b. The server file you're going to edit as add.lst or ad.conf depending on
       what version of PvPGN software you're using.
        
    c. READ THE HELP text at the beginning of the ad.conf file!

   
   Step through example:
   ---------------------
   a. create the graphic using your favourite graphic tool. Ensure that the output
      is saved in an appropriate format as discussed above, and adhere to the size.
   b. Convert the graphic to the desired file format. "*.smk" is preferred.
   c. Place your graphic file in the "files" directory on your server, follow the
      file naming conventions.
   d. Edit the ad.conf file making sure your follow the format. The text below is
      an example only!
      
 "ad001001.smk"  init    30 "http://www.yourwebsite.org"      0x001002  "SEXP"
 "ad001002.smk"  start   30 "http://www.yourwebsite.org"      0x001003  "SEXP"
 "ad001003.smk"  norm    30 "http://www.yourwebsite.org"      0x001001  "SEXP"
      
   e. Note the last column. This column will restrict display of this new 
      advertisement to the specific client gametag. So in this case Starcraft:Broodwar.
      Text of "NULL" is shown to all clients _except_ those with a specific gametag.
       
      Therefore you could have: 
      W3XP - Warcraft III - TFT (Expansion)
      WAR3 - Warcraft III - ROC
      D2XP - Diablo II - LoD (Expansion)
      D2DV - Diablo II
      SEXP - Starcraft - Broodwar (Expansion)
      STAR - Starcraft

    References:

    And in theory you can save banners from Battle.net by using the bnftp command.
    bnftp is supplied (included) with the latest releases (1.6.4 and higher, 
    possibly earlier) of PvPGN.
    You will need to know the exact filename.
