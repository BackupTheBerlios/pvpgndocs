<h2>WHAT'S NEW</h2>
<ol>
<li>Updated "Server List" link.
<li>Removed "Web Stats"....both links have been dead for too long.  Replaced with "Server Web Stats" and new link.  Thanks to U-238 and Storm for the stats.
<li>Updated/removed "World of Amadeus" link, if it's still valid, let me know, but it appears to be dead.
<li>Removed "Anti-Gremlin's PvPGN Instruction Guide", link is dead.
<li>I don't check my email much and had other personal problems (health issues) earlier this year.  For the past 3 months or so, I haven't been checking my email.  If you emailed me within that time period, I hope to get back to you shortly, but I'm fairly swamped at the moment with work. 
<li>This site might chug for a while.  I had a memory board go bad, which was causing all the ups and downs, so I'm running on half the RAM now.  I'll be getting some more memory shortly, but it's going to be a while. This motherboard is picky when it comes to memory.  Unless, someone feels like donating a faster computer than this old clunker.
<li><u>Please do NOT ask me for technical support</u>...thats what the <a href="http://forums.pvpgn.org/" target="web"><b>forums</b></a> and <a href="irc://irc.pvpgn.org/" target="web"><b>IRC</b></a> are for...thanks.

<h1>Installation/Setup Questions</h1>

<H2><A NAME="INS-Q1">How do I setup a PvPGN server in Windows?</A></H2>

<p>Download the latest version of PvPGN from <a href="#INT-Q3">here</a>.  The setup, described below, will allow you to play Warcraft II Battle Net Edition, Warcraft III Reign of Chaos, Starcraft, Starcraft Brood War & Diablo.  You will be unable to play Diablo II or Diablo II Lord of Destruction since they require d2cs, d2dbs and / or d2gs / D2Closed which is not discussed in this section.
<br><br>
I suggest getting your PvPGN server to work first before pursuing the d2* programs since you will be unable to use those programs unless PvPGN is setup & working properly.  Also, make sure that a Warcraft III loader is being used to connect to non-official Battle.net servers, when connecting with Warcraft III.
<ol>
<li>To install PvPGN: 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Simply run the exe file by double/single (depending how your system is setup) clicking on it.</b>
<br><br>
<li><b>Follow the instructions in the installer & click on finish to exit the installer when it's complete.</b>
</ul>
<br>

If you are using Windows XP, 2000, ME, or NT, you might want to consider installing PvPGN as a service instead, though this is not required.
<br><br>
To install PvPGN as a service, run the install program using the "-s install" switch.  Example:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>c:\pvpgn1.4.4.exe -s install</b>
<br><br>
Setup will say that it is <b>"Installing as a Service"</b>.
<br><br>
To start the PvPGN service, click on:
<br><br>
<li><b>Start</b>
<br>
<li><b>Settings</b>
<br>
<li><b>Control Panel</b>
<br>
<li><b>Administrative Tools</b>
<br>
<li><b>Services</b>
<br>
<li><b>Select the PvPGN service & click on the play like looking button to start the service</b>
<br><br>
If your experiencing problems, the exe file that you want to use as the service may need to be renamed to PvPGNEliteService.exe .
</ul>
<br>
If you want to uninstall the PvPGN service, run the install program again using the "-s uninstall" switch.  Example:
<ul>
<br>
<li><b>c:\pvpgn1.4.4.exe -s uninstall</b>
</ul>

<br><br>
<li>Now that PvPGN  is installed.  We need to configure PvPGN correctly before we can use it.  Go to the location where you installed PvPGN.  All of your configuration files, such as the <b>bnetd.conf</b> & log files are located there in sub-directories.
<br><br>
The default installation path is:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>c:\program files\the player -vs- player gaming network\pvpgn</b>
</ul>

<br><br>
<li>Go to <b>c:\program files\the player -vs- player gaming network\pvpgn\etc</b> & edit the <b>bnetd.conf</b> file with a text editor such as Notepad or Wordpad.
<br><br>
Their really are only 4 things that must be changed in the <b>bnetd.conf</b> file to get PvPGN running.  For now, leave all other settings alone, PvPGN should work just fine without changing any other settings.  Only change the settings specified below:
<br><br>

In the <b>bnetd.conf</b> file, look for the <b>"Storage section"</b> section.  Change the <b>storage_path</b> to either the desired storage type, either the file: or sql: mode.  Each are illustrated below:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>storage_path = file:c:\program files\the player -vs- player gaming network\pvpgn\users</b>
<br>
Stores user account data via flat files in the directory c:\program files\the player -vs- player gaming network\pvpgn\users.  No sql database is used in this mode.

<br><br>or<br><br>

<li><b>storage_path = sql:mode=mysql;host=127.0.0.1;name=PVPGN;user=pvpgn;pass=pvpgnrocks</b>
<br>
Stores user account data via an sql database.  This is more ideal for lots of users and/or live stats.  This setting must also be in one single line (as illustrated above).  For a break down of each sql setting, see <a href="#INS-Q3">How do I setup SQL support for PvPGN in Windows?</a>.
</ul>

<br>
Scroll down, look for the <b>"Message Logs"</b> section.  Change the <b>loglevel</b> to the following:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>loglevels &nbsp;=&nbsp; fatal,error,warn,info,trace,debug</b>
<br>
This tells PvPGN to log all possible errors including initialization, MySQL & connection errors.
</ul>

<br>
Scroll down until you get to the <b>"Server Network Info"</b> section.  Change the <b>servaddrs</b> to the following: 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>servaddrs &nbsp;=&nbsp; "0.0.0.0:6112"</b>
<br>
This will tell PvPGN to listen on port 6112 for both the TCP & UDP protocols, for all IP addresses on your computer.
</ul>

<br>
For the last line that needs to be changed in the <b>bnetd.conf</b> file, simply scroll down a few lines and change the <b>w3routeaddr</b>, which is also under the <b>"Server Network Info"</b> section, to the following:  
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>w3routeaddr &nbsp;=&nbsp; "X.X.X.X:6200"</b>
<br>
Replace X.X.X.X with your IP address.  This must be a specific IP address or a domain name such as www.pvpgn.org, 0.0.0.0:6200 won't work.  This tells the PvPGN Warcraft III router to listen on port 6200 for the TCP protocol.  This will route Warcraft III data to PvPGN.
</ul>

<br>
Scroll down once again & until you get to the <b>w3routeshow</b> line.  Enable & change this only if your using NAT, behind a router, gateway, etc.  If your not sure, just leave this alone.  
<br><br>
Try using <b>w3routeaddr</b> first, if your having problems connecting with Warcraft III, then enable <b>w3routeshow</b>.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>W3routeshow</b> is disabled by default & should be left that way unless your experiencing problems.
<br><br>
<li><b>#w3routeshow &nbsp;=&nbsp; "127.0.0.1:6200"</b>
<br>
This tells PvPGN to listen on port 6200 for the TCP protocol, on localhost (127.0.0.1), on your computer.  If you enable this, change this to your internet IP address or domain name, followed by the colon and port number.
</ul>
<br>
Save & close your text editor.

<br><br><br>
<li>Now, open ports 6112 & 6200 if your using a firewall.  If your behind a router, forward ports 6112 & 6200 to your computer or register the internal IP address of the computer running PvPGN as a DMZ in the router.  If your using Windows XP, it has a firewall that is installed by default.  Make sure to allow incoming & outgoing access to ports 6112 & 6200, if the firewall is enabled, or you will be unable to connect to your PvPGN server.

<br><br><br>
<li>Now your ready to start PvPGN.
<br><br>

On your taskbar, click on:
<ul>
<li><b>Start</b>
<br>
<li><b>Programs</b>
<br>
<li><b>Player -vs- Player Gaming Network</b>
<br>
<li><b>PvPGN</b>
</ul>
</li></ul>
</ol>

<br>

<p>After starting PvPGN, open your bnetd log file.  It should look something like this:

<H2><A NAME="INS-Q2">How do I setup a PvPGN server on *nix based systems?</A></H2>

First, download the source.  You can download the latest version <a href="#INT-Q3">here</a>.  Then, proceed to install PvPGN.
<OL>
<li>Installing PvPGN on *nix based systems...has many more options than the Windows version.  Read this section thoroughly before doing anything as you may wish to use different options based on your needs or system setup.  The tar file must file be uncompressed first.  Login as <b>root</b>, go to the directory where you downloaded PvPGN & type something like this: 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>tar xvzf pvpgn.tar.gz</b>
<br>
This tells tar to create a directory using the tar file name & uncompress the files in the tar file to that directory.  Make sure you change <b>pvpgn.tar.gz</b> to the tar file name your going to uncompress. 
<br><br>
<li><b>cd pvpgn/src</b>
<br>
This changes us to the pvpgn directory where you uncompressed the tar file, with the sub-directory src, which is where the PvPGN source is located.

<br><br>
Now we need to configure the installer before we can compile.  Their are several different switches for this depending whether you want to install PvPGN with MySQL support, change the default installation location, etc.  Only the most common switches are used below all though their are more switches than illustrated below.
<br><br>
<li><b>./configure</b>
<br>
This will configure PvPGN with the default install location & without MySQL.  User accounts will be stored via flat files.  PvPGN's files will be installed in <b>/usr/local</b> in subdirectories.
<br><br>
<li><b>./configure --with-mysql</b>
<br>
Using the <b>--with-mysql</b> switch will configure PvPGN using the MySQL database to store it's user accounts & stats.  This is a good idea if you plan on having a lot of user accounts.  Requires MySQL to be installed & running.
<br><br>
<li><b>./configure --prefix="/home/www/bnetd"</b>
<br>
By default, PvPGN will install to <b>/usr/local</b>.  If you want it to install to a different directory, change the <b>--prefix</b> path to where ever you want to install PvPGN.  In this example, PvPGN would install to <b>/home/www/bnetd</b>.
<br><br>
<li><b>./configure --with-mysql --prefix="/home/www/bnetd"</b>
<br>
You can also use the switches together.  Such as the above example would install MySQL support and install PvPGN in the <b>/home/www/bnetd</b> directory 
<br><br>

Now that installer for PvPGN is configured.  We can compile it using standard *nix commands.  Type this at the bash prompt:
<br><br>
<li><b>make</b>
<br>
This compiles PvPGN based on the setting from the configure script.
<br><br>
<li><b>make install</b>
<br>
Make install copies all the appropriate files to their locations.  Otherwise, you'd have to manually copy the compiled files to their proper locations or simple run PvPGN from where you compiled it.
</ul>
<br><br>

<li>Now that PvPGN is installed, we need to configure PvPGN correctly before we can use it. Go to the location where PvPGN is installed. All of your configuration files, such as the bnetd.conf & log files are located there in sub-directories. 
<br><br>
The default installation path for *nix based systems is:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>/usr/local</b>
<br>
</ul>

<br><br>
<li>Go to the <b>etc</b> sub-directory & edit the <b>bnetd.conf</b> file with a text editor such as emacs, xemacs, pico, vi, etc.
<br><br>
Their really are only 4 things that must be changed in the bnetd.conf file to get PvPGN running. For now, leave all other settings alone, PvPGN should work just fine without changing any other settings in the <b>bnetd.conf</b> file. Only change the settings specified below:
<br><br>

In the <b>bnetd.conf</b> file, look for the <b>"Storage section"</b> section.  Change the <b>storage_path</b> to either the desired storage type, either the file: or sql: mode.  Each are illustrated below:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>storage_path = file:/usr/local/var/users</b>
<br>
Stores user account data via flat files in the directory /usr/local/var/users.  No sql database is used in this mode.

<br><br>or<br><br>

<li><b>storage_path = sql:mode=mysql;host=127.0.0.1;name=PVPGN;user=pvpgn;pass=pvpgnrocks</b>
<br>
Stores user account data via an sql database.  This is more ideal for lots of users and/or live stats.  This setting must also be in one single line (as illustrated above).  For a break down of each sql setting, see <a href="#INS-Q4">How do I setup SQL support for PvPGN on *nix based systems?</a>.
</ul>

<br>
Scroll down, look for the <b>"Message Logs"</b> section.  Change the <b>loglevel</b> to the following:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>loglevels &nbsp;=&nbsp; fatal,error,warn,info,trace,debug</b>
<br>
This tells PvPGN to log all possible errors including initialization, MySQL & connection errors.  It might be a good idea, after PvPGN is up & running, to scale these setting back to something like <b>fatal,warn</b>.  This will help log unwanted jargon & make the log easier to read.
</ul>

<br>
Scroll down until you get to the <b>"Server Network Info"</b> section.  Change the <b>servaddrs</b> to the following: 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>servaddrs &nbsp;=&nbsp; "0.0.0.0:6112"</b>
<br>
This tell's PvPGN to listen on port 6112 for both the TCP & UDP protocols, for all IP addresses on your computer.
</ul>

<br>
For the last line that needs to be changed in the <b>bnetd.conf</b> file, simply scroll down a few lines and change the <b>w3routeaddr</b>, which is also under the <b>"Server Network Info"</b> section, to the following:  
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>w3routeaddr &nbsp;=&nbsp; "X.X.X.X:6200"</b>
<br>
Replace X.X.X.X with your IP address.  This must be a specific IP address or a domain name such as www.pvpgn.org, 0.0.0.0:6200 won't work.  This will tell the PvPGN Warcraft III router to listen on port 6200 for the TCP protocol.  This will route Warcraft III data to PvPGN.
</ul>

<br>
Scroll down once again & until you get to the <b>w3routeshow</b> line.  In PvPGN version 1.1.6x & newer, a <b>w3routeshow</b> option is available.  Enable & change this only if your using NAT, behind a router, gateway, etc.  If your not sure, just leave this alone.  
<br><br>
Try using <b>w3routeaddr</b> first, if your having problems connecting with Warcraft III, then enable <b>w3routeshow</b>.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>W3routeshow</b> is disabled by default & should be left that way unless your experiencing problems.
<br><br>
<li><b>#w3routeshow &nbsp;=&nbsp; "127.0.0.1:6200"</b>
<br>
This tell's PvPGN to listen on port 6200 for the TCP protocol, on localhost (127.0.0.1), on your computer.  If you decide to enable this, change this to your internet IP address or domain name.
</ul>
<br>
Save & close your text editor.

<br><br><br>
<li>Now, open ports 6112 & 6200 if your using a firewall, such as packet filtering, like iptables. If your behind a router, forward ports 6112 & 6200 to your computer or register your computer as a DMZ in the router settings. 

<br><br><br>
<li>Now your ready to start PvPGN.
  
<br><br>
On *nix based systems type:
<ul>
<li><b>/usr/local/sbin/bnetd</b>
<br>
If PvPGN is installed in a different directory, change the path accordingly.
</ul>
</li></ul>
</ol>

<br>
<table>
<p>After starting PvPGN, check the bnetd log file <b>(/usr/local/var/log/bnetd)</b>.  
<br>It should look something like this:
<br><br>

<H2><A NAME="INS-Q3">How do I setup SQL support for PvPGN in Windows?</A></H2>

<p>Make sure that both SQL & PvPGN are installed.  Close PvPGN if it is running, then:  
<ol>

<br>
<li>Edit the <b>bnetd.conf</b> file, located in the <b>c:\program files\the player -vs- player gaming network\pvpgn\etc</b> directory by default.  Scroll down to the bottom of the file to the <b>"Storage section"</b> section.  In most cases, just leave everything the way it already is by default.  <u><b>Make sure this command is one line (as illustrated below)</b></u>.  
<br><br>
<b>storage_path = sql:mode=mysql;host=127.0.0.1;name=PVPGN;user=pvpgn;pass=pvpgnrocks</b>
<br><br>
Settings broken down...
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>mode &nbsp;=&nbsp; mysql</b>
<br>
The type of sql database PvPGN will be connecting to.  Options could be mysql, pgsql and so forth.
<br><br>
<li><b>host &nbsp;=&nbsp; localhost</b>
<br>
The computer sql is installed on & where the database for PvPGN will be kept.  90% of the time, localhost will work just fine.  This tells PvPGN to connect to the same computer it's running on for the sql database.  If you are running sql on a different computer other than the computer PvPGN is running on, change this to the IP address of the remote computer that has sql installed on it.
<br><br>
<li><b>name &nbsp;=&nbsp; PVPGN</b>
<br>
The database name that PvPGN will use.  In most cases, just leave this alone.
<br><br>
<li><b>user &nbsp;=&nbsp; pvpgn</b>
<br>
The user name that the PvPGN will use to log into the database with.  In most cases, just leave this alone.
<br><br>
<li><b>pass &nbsp;=&nbsp; pvpgnrocks</b>
<br>
The password that the PvPGN will use to log into database with.  In most cases, just leave this alone.
</ul>
<br>
Save & close your text editor, then start PvPGN.

<H2><A NAME="INS-Q4">How do I setup SQL support for PvPGN on *nix based systems?</A></H2>

<p>Make sure MySQL is installed & configured properly.  If you installed the rpm files, make sure that MySQL, MySQL-Client and MySQL-Shared are installed.
<OL>
<li>Compile PvPGN with MySQL support, example:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>./configure --with-mysql</b>
<br>
<li><b>make</b>
<br>
<li><b>make install</b>
</ul>

<br><br>

In most cases, just leave everything the way it already is by default.  <u><b>Make sure this command is one line (as illustrated below)</b></u>.  
<br><br>
<b>storage_path = sql:mode=mysql;host=127.0.0.1;name=PVPGN;user=pvpgn;pass=pvpgnrocks</b>
<br><br>

<br>
<ul>
<li><b>mode &nbsp;=&nbsp; mysql</b>
<br>
The type of sql database PvPGN will be connecting to.  Options could be mysql, pgsql and so forth.
<br><br>
<li><b>host &nbsp;=&nbsp; localhost</b>
<br>
The computer sql is installed on & where the database for PvPGN will be kept.  90% of the time, localhost will work just fine.  This tells PvPGN to connect to the same computer it's running on for the sql database.  If you are running sql on a different computer other than the computer PvPGN is running on, change this to the IP address of the remote computer that has sql installed on it.
<br><br>
<li><b>name &nbsp;=&nbsp; PVPGN</b>
<br>
The database name that PvPGN will use.  In most cases, just leave this alone.
<br><br>
<li><b>user &nbsp;=&nbsp; pvpgn</b>
<br>
The user name that the PvPGN will use to log into the database with.  In most cases, just leave this alone.
<br><br>
<li><b>pass &nbsp;=&nbsp; pvpgnrocks</b>
<br>
The password that the PvPGN will use to log into database with.  In most cases, just leave this alone.
</ul>

<br><br>
<li>Now that the database connection information is in the bnetd.conf file, the database needs to be created.  PvPGN will automatically create the database upon startup using the "db configuration" supplied in the bnetd.conf file.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>To automatically create the database, simply run PvPGN & it should create the database name defined in the "db configuration" from the bnetd.conf file.</b>
<br><br>
<li>It might be nessecary to create the username and password manually if it hasn't already be created.  For instructions how to do this, scroll down pass the information on how to create the database manually.  
<br><br>
</ul>
If you wish to create the database manually, go to the directory where you uncompressed the source.  At the bash prompt, type:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>mysqladmin -u root -p create PVPGN</b>
<br>
This creates the database PVPGN.
<br><br>
<li><b>mysql -u root -p PVPGN < dbdump.txt</b>
<br>
We need to put something in the PvPGN database, this creates the tables & indexes.
</ul>

<br>
Now that the database has been created, we need to create a user & password.  Login it to the PVPGN database & add the pvpgn username & password using the GRANT privileges illustrated below (type in everything in bold exactly as illustrated below, including the text in caps & semi-colons):
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>mysql -u root -p PVPGN</b>
<br>
Login to PVPGN database as root.
<br><br>
<li><b>mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO pvpgn@localhost</b>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>-> IDENTIFIED BY 'bnetd' WITH GRANT OPTION;</b>
<br>
Creates the user pvpgn with the password bnetd.  Type this in exactly as shown above.
<br><br>
<li><b>mysql> \q</b>
<br>
Quits the MySQL prompt.
</ul>

<br><br>
<li>For the last step, let's check and make sure we didn't make any errors.  At the bash prompt, type:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>mysql -u pvpgn -pbnetd PVPGN</b>
<br>
This will log you into the PVPGN database as the user pvpgn with the password bnetd
<br><br>
</ul>
If all went well, you should be at the MySQL prompt, type <b>\q</b> to quit and return to the bash prompt.  If not, then log back into the PVPGN database as root and use the <b>FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</b> command at the MySQL prompt to flush the users.  Then go back and do step 3 again.  Make sure to include the "<b>;</b>" at the ends of the lines that need them, otherwise it might not work right.

<H2><A NAME="INS-Q5">How do I setup PvPGN as a service in Windows?</A></H2>

<p>Running PvPGN as a service will only work in Windows NT, Me, 2000 & XP!

<ol>
<li>Run the install program using the "-s install" switch.  Example:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>c:\pvpgn1.4.4.exe -s install</b>
<br><br>
The setup will say "Installing as a Service".
<br><br>
To start PvPGN, simply go to the control panel, admin tools, services, then start the PvPGN service.
<br><br>
If your experiencing problems, the exe file that you want to use as the service may need to be renamed to PvPGNEliteService.exe .
</ul>
<br><br>
<li>To uninstall the PvPGN service, run the install program using the "-s uninstall" switch.  Example:

<H2><A NAME="INS-Q6">How do I setup D2Closed, what's it for & where can I get it?</A></H2>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5px" align="justify">
D2Closed is the Windows version of the D2CS & D2DBS programs which are the programs required to host both open & closed Diablo II games.  Running PvPGN & D2Closed, without d2gs, will only support Diablo II open player support.  What's an Open Server?  <a href="#GEN-Q1">Click here</a> to find out.
<br><br>
Before making any configuration changes, make sure that PvPGN works ok on it's own before attempting to run D2Closed.  D2Closed will attempt to connect & create a link between it and PvPGN.  This is why it is so important to have PvPGN working before attempting to run D2Closed.
<br><br>
Also, the D2Closed server requires the Lord of Destruction expansion pack files, so make sure it's installed.  If you try to run D2Closed in Classic mode, the service will report a "Server Mutex" error and die.
</p>
<p>Lets start the installation process:
<br><br><br>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://pvpgn-files.ath.cx/D2Closed/" target="web"><b>Download</b></a> & install the D2Closed Realm Server. 
<br><br><br>

<li>Go to the path where D2Closed is installed, in the <b>conf</b> sub-directory & edit the <b>d2closed.conf</b> file.  

<br><br><br>
<li>Look for the <b>"Server Major Settings"</b> section.  Scroll down to the <b>d2cs_servaddrs</b> field, make it look something like this:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>d2cs_servaddrs &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0.0.0.0:6113</b>
<br>
This tells the D2CS portion of D2Closed to listen on port 6113, using the TCP protocol, on all IP addresses.
</ul>

<br><br>
Scroll down to the <b>d2dbs_servaddrs</b> field & make it look like this:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>d2dbs_servaddrs &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0.0.0.0:6114</b>
<br>
This tells the D2DBS portion of D2Closed to listen on port 6114, using the TCP protocol, on all IP addresses.
</ul>

<br><br>
Scroll down to the <b>bnetdaddr</b> field & make it look like this:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>bnetdaddr &nbsp;=&nbsp; X.X.X.X:6112</b>
<br>
Replace X.X.X.X with the IP address of the computer that PvPGN is running on.  If PvPGN is running on the same machine as D2Closed, 0.0.0.0:6112 should work as well.
</ul>

<br><br>
Scroll down to the <b>gameservlist</b> field.  This field should be commented out by default via a <b>"#"</b>, which tells D2Closed to ignore this line.  Unless you plan on using D2GS, which will not be discussed in this section, leave this commented out:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>#gameservlist &nbsp;=&nbsp; your.gameserver</b>
<br>
This has a hash in front of it by default & really should be left that way unless you plan on running a <a href="#GEN-Q1">Diablo II Closed Server</a>.  Basically, if you are also running D2GS, you would enable this line & replace <b>your.gameserver</b> with the IP address of your D2GS server.
</ul>

<br><br>
Scroll down & go to the <b>realmname</b> field & make it look like this:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>realmname &nbsp;=&nbsp; "D2Closed"</b>
<br>
This is the realm name D2Closed will attempt to use when a user connects.  Leave this the way it is for now.
</ul>

<br><br>
The last setting to that should be changed in the <b>d2closed.conf</b> file are the <b>loglevels</b> located in the <b>"Message Logs"</b> section.  Scroll down & change <b>loglevels</b> to:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>loglevels &nbsp;=&nbsp; fatal,error,warn,info,trace,debug</b>
<br>
This tells D2Closed to log all possible errors & trace information so we can see who connects to D2Closed.
</ul>

<br><br>
<li>Leave the rest of the settings alone for now.  Save & close your text editor.  D2Closed should run just fine without any other changes.

<br><br><br>
<li>Now at least part of D2Closed is configured but their still is another file that must be changed before we can run D2Closed.  The realm list needs to be configured so D2Closed knows what IP address the "D2Closed" realm goes to.  Edit the <b>realm.list</b> file, located in the <b>etc</b> sub-directory on your PvPGN server.  
<ul>
<br>
<li>Note that if the <b>----realm name----</b> is "D2CS", then it should be changed to "D2Closed".
<br><br>
<li>Also, make sure that the D2Closed realm line isn't hashed (<b>#</b>) out.  So basically, make sure their no <b>#</b> in front of the D2Closed line.  This sample illustrates the <b>CORRECT</b> setup.
</ul>

<br><br>
<li>Under the <b>-----realm name-----</b> section, change this to what we defined the <b>realmname</b> in the d2closed.conf file, which was:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> <b>"D2Closed"</b>
<br>
Since we defined "D2Closed" for the <b>realmname</b> in the d2closed.conf file, that is what the <b>-----realm name-----</b> should be.  If you used a different name for the <b>realmname</b> field in the d2closed.conf file, change this accordingly.
</ul>

<br>
<li>Change the <b>-----description-----</b> section to what ever description you want for this realm.  This is really irrelivent & doesn't effect anything if left the way it is.

<br><br>
<li>Change the <b>----ip:port----</b> section, change this to the exact IP address of the computer that is running D2Closed on it, which is illustrated below.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>X.X.X.X:6113</b>
<br>
Replace X.X.X.X with the IP address of the computer that D2Closed is running on.  This must be specific, 0.0.0.0:6113 won't work.
</ul>


<br>
<li>Make sure port 6113 is open to the world for the TCP protocol.  Opening port 6114 to the world isn't necessary.  Just make sure that port 6112 is open for both the TCP & UDP protocols & that port 6113 is open for the TCP protocol. 

<br><br><br>
<li>Now your ready to start D2Closed.  Make sure you have PvPGN started first & running or D2Closed will fail & close itself.

<br><br><br>
<li>To start D2Closed, run:
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>c:\program files\D2Closed-1.0\d2closed.exe</b>

If D2Closed is installed in a different directory, change the path accordingly.

<H2><A NAME="INS-Q7">How do I setup D2CS & D2DBS in Windows via Cygwin?</A></H2>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5px" align="justify">
The *nix version of D2CS & D2DBS can also be comipled to run under Windows using Cygwin.  This was originally, the only way to run D2CS & D2DBS on Windows before D2Closed came out.  Firstof9 has an excellent article, incorporated below, that explains how to do this.  I've integrated this into this section as bits & pieces.  If you would like to see the original article by firstof9, <a href="originals/how_to_compile_pvpgn_linux_distro_in_win32.txt">click here</a>.
<br><br>
Before you do anything, make sure that PvPGN works ok on it's own before attempting to run D2CS or D2DBS.  D2CS will attempt to connect & create a link between it and PvPGN.  D2CS will also attempt to connect to D2DBS for the ladder data.  This is why it is so important to have PvPGN working before attempting to load D2CS or D2DBS.
<br><br>
D2CS & D2DBS must both be installed & loaded in order to host a Diablo II Open Server.  What's an Open Server?  <a href="#GEN-Q1">Click here</a> to find out. 
</p>
<p>Lets start the installation process:
<br><br><br>

<ol>
<li>Download & install <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="web">Cygwin</a>.  Cygwin will allow you to run *nix based programs under Windows by emulating a *nix based bash console.
<br><br><br>

<li>Run Cygwin and type the following below to download the *nix distribution of PvPGN. This will download the *nix version of PvPGN which has the source for D2CS & D2DBS in it.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>wget http://pvpgn.home.ro/pvpgn-1.4.4.tar.gz</b>
<br>
This will download the *nix source via a compressed tar file.  Change the web path & tar file name if necessary.
</ul>
<br><br>

<li>Uncompress the tar file by typing:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>tar -zxvf pvpgn-1.4.4.tar.gz</b>
<br>
This will create a directory called pvpgn-1.1.7rc1 & uncompress the files their.
</ul>
<br><br>

<li>Now, change to the directory the tar files where uncompressed to by typing:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>cd pvpgn-1.4.4\src</b>
<br>
This will take you to the directory the uncompressed files directory, under the PvPGN source sub-directory.  Remember, *nix is caps sensitive, keep everything in lower case to make things easy.
</ul>
<br><br>

<li>Configure the installer as if you where in *nix by typing:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>./configure</b>
<br>
This will grab your system variables.  Such as your processor info, installed programs, etc.
</ul>
<br><br>

<li>Time to compile, type:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>make</b>
<br>
Compiles PvPGN.
</ul>
<br><br>

<li>Now that where done compiling, the files need to be copied from the temp directory to a permanent location, type:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>make install</b>
<br>
Copies all required files to the /usr/local directory location.
</ul>
<br><br>

<li>Minimize the Cygwin program & open the following:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Open <b>Explorer</b>
<li>Open the path <b>c:\cygwin\usr\local\etc</b>
<br><br>
This will be where the configuration files will be...d2cs.conf for D2CS & d2dbs.conf for D2DBS.
<br><br>
Now, your ready to configure D2CS & D2DBS.
</ul>
<br><br>

<li>First, lets start out on how to setup D2CS.  D2CS is the realm server which handles realm requests.  Go to the path where you install PvPGN in the <b>etc</b> sub-directory & edit the <b>d2cs.conf</b> file.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>In the <b>d2cs.conf</b> file, look for the <b>"Server Major Settings"</b> section.  Scroll down to the <b>realmname</b>, it should look like this:
<br><br>
<li><b>realmname &nbsp;=&nbsp; D2CS</b>
<br>
This is the realm name D2CS will attempt to use when a user connects.  Leave this the way it is for now.
</ul>
<br>
Now go to the <b>servaddrs</b> field & make it look like this:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>servaddrs &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0.0.0.0:6113</b>
<br>
This tells D2CS to listen on port 6113, using the TCP protocol, on all IP addresses.
</ul>

<br>
Scroll down to <b>gameservlist</b>.  This field should be commented out by default via a <b>"#"</b>, which tells D2CS to ignore this line.  Unless you plan on using D2GS, which will not be discussed in this section, leave this commented out:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>#gameservlist &nbsp;=&nbsp; your.gameserver</b>
<br>
This has a hash in front of it by default & really should be left that way unless you plan on running a <a href="#GEN-Q1">Diablo II Closed Server</a>.  Basically, if you are also running D2GS, you would enable this line & change this to the IP address of your D2GS server, which is not discussed in this section.
</ul>

<br>
Now for the final setting before we can start D2CS.  Scroll down again to <b>bnetdaddr</b>.  This field is the IP address PvPGN is running on.  D2CS attempts to connect to PvPGN & create a link or route.  So that when someone connects with Diablo II, PvPGN will route them to the D2CS daemon.  This would typically be the exact same IP address & port of the <b>servaddrs</b> in the <b>bnetd.conf</b> file.  For now set it like this:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>bnetdaddr &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0.0.0.0:6112</b>
<br>
This tells D2CS to initiate it's connection/hand-shaking procedure to any IP address on your system that is listening on the TCP protocol on port 6112.  Which would typically be PvPGN assuming you used the instructions for setting up a PvPGN server above.
</ul>

<br>
The last setting to that should be changed in the <b>d2cs.conf</b> file are the <b>loglevels</b> located in the <b>"Message Logs"</b> section.  Scroll down & change <b>loglevels</b> to:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>loglevels &nbsp;=&nbsp; fatal,error,warn,info,trace,debug</b>
<br>
This tells D2CS to log all possible errors & trace information so we can see who connects to D2CS.
</ul>
<br>
Save & close your text editor.  Leave the rest of the settings alone in the <b>d2cs.conf</b>.  D2CS should run file without any other changes.

<br><br><br>
<li>Now at least part of D2CS is configured but their still is another file that must be changed before you can move on to configuring D2DBS.  The realm list needs to be configured so D2CS knows what IP address the D2CS realm goes to.  Edit the <b>realm.list</b> file, also located in the <b>etc</b> sub-directory. 
<ul>
<br>
<li>For starters, make sure the D2CS realm line isn't hashed (<b>#</b>) out.  So basically, make sure their no <b>#</b> in front of the D2CS line.  This sample illustrates the <b>CORRECT</b> setup.

</TABLE>
</center>

<br><br>
Under the <b>----ip:port----</b> section, change this to the exact IP address of the computer that is running D2CS on it, which is illustrated below.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>X.X.X.X:6113</b>
<br>
Replace X.X.X.X with the IP address of the computer that D2CS is running on.  This must be specific, 0.0.0.0:6113 won't work.
</ul>

<br>
<p>Save & close your text editor.  Now that you are finished setting up D2CS, D2DBS needs to be setup.  Your might notice that setting up D2DBS is almost exactly like setting up D2CS, with a few minor differences, like the port number D2DBS uses.
<br><br><br>

<li>To setup D2DBS, edit the <b>d2dbs.conf</b> file located in the <b>etc</b> sub-directory.  Scroll down to the <b>"Server Major Settings"</b> section & change <b>servaddrs</b> to:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>servaddrs &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0.0.0.0:6114</b>
<br>
This tells D2DBS to listen on port 6114, using the TCP protocol, on all IP addresses.
</ul>

<br>
Scroll down to <b>gameservlist</b>.  This field should be commented out by default via a <b>"#"</b>, which tells D2DBS to ignore this line.  Unless you plan on using creating different realms (other than the default D2CS realm) which will not be discussed here, leave this commented out:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>#gameservlist &nbsp;=&nbsp; your.gameserver</b>
<br>
This has a hash in front of it by default & really should be left that way unless you plan on running a <a href="#GEN-Q1">Diablo II Closed Server</a>.  Basically, if you are also running D2GS, you would enable this line & change this to the IP address of your D2GS server, which is not discussed in this section. 
</ul>

<br>
The last setting to that should be changed in the <b>d2dbs.conf</b> file are the <b>loglevels</b> located in the <b>"Message Logs"</b> section.  Scroll down & change <b>loglevels</b> to:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>loglevels &nbsp;=&nbsp; fatal,error,warn,info,trace,debug</b>
<br>
This tells D2DBS to log all possible errors including ladder loading errors.
</ul>
<br>
Save & close your text editor.  Leave the rest of the settings alone in the <b>d2dbs.conf</b>.  D2DBS should run file without any other changes.

<br><br><br>
<li>Now, make sure port 6113 is open to the world for the TCP protocol.  Opening port 6114 to the world isn't necessary.  D2CS & D2DBS use these ports to communicate to PvPGN & each other during game initialization.  Just make sure that port 6112 is open for both the TCP & UDP protocols & that port 6113 is open for the TCP protocol. 

<br><br><br>
<li>Now your ready to start D2CS & D2DBS.  Make sure you have PvPGN started first & running or D2CS will fail & close itself.

<br><br><br>
<li>To start D2CS & D2DBS, hit alt+tab & select Cygwin.  You should be back in the Cygwin prompt, then type:
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>/usr/local/sbin/d2cs</b>
<br>
and
<li><b>/usr/local/sbin/d2dbs</b>
<br>
If you installed D2CS or D2DBS in a different directory, change the path accordingly.
</ul>

<br>
<li>To check to see if everything went well:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Hit <b>Ctrl+Alt+Del</b>
<li>Select <b>Task Manager</b>
<li>You should see D2CS & D2DBS running
</ul>
</li></ul>
</ol>

<H2><A NAME="INS-Q8">How do I setup D2CS & D2DBS on *nix based systems?</A></H2>

Make sure that PvPGN works ok on it's own before attempting to run D2CS or D2DBS.  D2CS will attempt to connect & create a link between it and PvPGN.  D2CS will also attempt to connect to D2DBS for the ladder data.  This is why it is so important to have PvPGN working before attempting to load D2CS or D2DBS.  Also, I'm not sure whether or not D2CS or D2DBS will run under Windows.
<br><br>
D2CS & D2DBS must both be installed & loaded in order to host a Diablo II Open Server.  What's an Open Server?  <a href="#GEN-Q1">Click here</a> to find out. 
<br><br>
First lets start out on how to setup D2CS.  D2CS is the realm server which handles realm requests.  Go to the path where you install PvPGN in the <b>etc</b> sub-directory & edit the <b>d2cs.conf</b> file.
<ol>
<li>In the <b>d2cs.conf</b> file, look for the <b>"Server Major Settings"</b> section.  Scroll down to the <b>realmname</b>, it should look like this:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>realmname &nbsp;=&nbsp; D2CS</b>
<br>
This is the realm name D2CS will attempt to use when a user connects.  Leave this the way it is for now.
</ul>
<br>
Now go to the <b>servaddrs</b> field & make it look like this:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>servaddrs &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0.0.0.0:6113</b>
<br>
This tells D2CS to listen on port 6113, using the TCP protocol, on all IP addresses.
</ul>

<br>
Scroll down to <b>gameservlist</b>.  This field should be commented out by default via a <b>"#"</b>, which tells D2CS to ignore this line.  Unless you plan on using D2GS, which will not be discussed in this section, leave this commented out:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>#gameservlist &nbsp;=&nbsp; your.gameserver</b>
<br>
This has a hash in front of it by default & really should be left that way unless you plan on running a <a href="#GEN-Q1">Diablo II Closed Server</a>.  Basically, if you are also running D2GS, you would enable this line & change this to the IP address of your D2GS server, which is not discussed in this section.
</ul>

<br>
Now for the final setting before we can start D2CS.  Scroll down again to <b>bnetdaddr</b>.  This field is the IP address PvPGN is running on.  D2CS attempts to connect to PvPGN & create a link or route.  So that when someone connects with Diablo II, PvPGN will route them to the D2CS daemon.  This would typically be the exact same IP address & port of the <b>servaddrs</b> in the <b>bnetd.conf</b> file.  For now set it like this:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>bnetdaddr &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0.0.0.0:6112</b>
<br>
This tells D2CS to initiate it's connection/hand-shaking procedure to any IP address on your system that is listening on the TCP protocol on port 6112.  Which would typically be PvPGN assuming you used the instructions for setting up a PvPGN server above.
</ul>

<br>
The last setting to that should be changed in the <b>d2cs.conf</b> file are the <b>loglevels</b> located in the <b>"Message Logs"</b> section.  Scroll down & change <b>loglevels</b> to:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>loglevels &nbsp;=&nbsp; fatal,error,warn,info,trace,debug</b>
<br>
This tells D2CS to log all possible errors & trace information so we can see who connects to D2CS.
</ul>
<br>
Save & close your text editor.  Leave the rest of the settings alone in the <b>d2cs.conf</b>.  D2CS should run file without any other changes.

<br><br><br>
<li>Now at least part of D2CS is configured but their still is another file that must be changed before you can move on to configuring D2DBS.  The realm list needs to be configured so D2CS knows what IP address the D2CS realm goes to.  Edit the <b>realm.list</b> file, also located in the <b>etc</b> sub-directory. 
<ul>
<br>
<li>For starters, make sure the D2CS realm line isn't hashed (<b>#</b>) out.  So basically, make sure their no <b>#</b> in front of the D2CS line.  This sample illustrates the <b>CORRECT</b> setup.

The illustration below is a sample of an <b>INCORRECT</b> setup.  Notice the hash in front of the D2CS line.
<br><br>

<TD><b> # ------realm name------ </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>   </TD>
<td align="right"> # </TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>
</center>

<br><br>
Under the <b>----ip:port----</b> section, change this to the exact IP address of the computer that is running D2CS on it, which is illustrated below.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>X.X.X.X:6113</b>
<br>
Replace X.X.X.X with the IP address of the computer that D2CS is running on.  This must be specific, 0.0.0.0:6113 won't work.
</ul>
<br>
Save & close your text editor.  Now that you are finished setting up D2CS, D2DBS needs to be setup.  Your might notice that setting up D2DBS is almost exactly like setting up D2CS, with a few minor differences, like the port number D2DBS uses.
<br><br><br>

To setup D2DBS, edit the <b>d2dbs.conf</b> file located in the <b>etc</b> sub-directory.  Scroll down to the <b>"Server Major Settings"</b> section & change <b>servaddrs</b> to:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>servaddrs &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0.0.0.0:6114</b>
<br>
This tells D2DBS to listen on port 6114, using the TCP protocol, on all IP addresses.
</ul>

<br>
Scroll down to <b>gameservlist</b>.  This field should be commented out by default via a <b>"#"</b>, which tells D2DBS to ignore this line.  Unless you plan on using creating different realms (other than the default D2CS realm) which will not be discussed here, leave this commented out:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>#gameservlist &nbsp;=&nbsp; your.gameserver</b>
<br>
This has a hash in front of it by default & really should be left that way unless you plan on running a <a href="#GEN-Q1">Diablo II Closed Server</a>.  Basically, if you are also running D2GS, you would enable this line & change this to the IP address of your D2GS server, which is not discussed in this section. 
</ul>

<br>
The last setting to that should be changed in the <b>d2dbs.conf</b> file are the <b>loglevels</b> located in the <b>"Message Logs"</b> section.  Scroll down & change <b>loglevels</b> to:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>loglevels &nbsp;=&nbsp; fatal,error,warn,info,trace,debug</b>
<br>
This tells D2DBS to log all possible errors including ladder loading errors.
</ul>
<br>
Save & close your text editor.  Leave the rest of the settings alone in the <b>d2dbs.conf</b>.  D2DBS should run file without any other changes.

<br><br><br>
<li>Now, make sure port 6113 is open to the world for the TCP protocol.  Opening port 6114 to the world isn't necessary.  D2CS & D2DBS use these ports to communicate to PvPGN & each other during game initialization.  Just make sure that port 6112 is open for both the TCP & UDP protocols & that port 6113 is open for the TCP protocol. 

<br><br><br>
<li>Now your ready to start D2CS & D2DBS.  Make sure you have PvPGN started first & running or D2CS will fail & close itself.
  
<br><br>
On *nix based systems type:
<ul>
<li><b>/usr/local/sbin/d2cs</b>
<br>
and
<li><b>/usr/local/sbin/d2dbs</b>
<br>
If you installed D2CS or D2DBS in a different directory, change the path accordingly.
</ul>
</li></ul>
</ol>

<H2><A NAME="INS-Q9">How do I setup D2GS, what's it for & where can I get it?</A></H2>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5px" align="justify">
D2GS is to host a Diablo II Closed Server.  What's a Closed Server?  <a href="#GEN-Q1">Click here</a> to find out.  D2GS works in conjunction with D2CS & D2DBS or D2Closed.  While D2CS & D2DBS or D2Closed (if your using Windows), are for hosting an Open Server, D2GS is the Game Server (that's what the GS stands for) that handles the closed game initialization.  You may have noticed that if you connect with Diablo II to PvPGN using the Battle.net button, with D2CS & D2DBS running, everything is fine except that when you create a game, it says you are number 1 in the queue & the game never starts.  This is where D2GS steps into play.
<br><br>
D2GS is currently a Windows binary & their is no *nix based version.  If you want to run D2GS under *nix, use <a href="http://www.winehq.com/" target="web">wine</a>.  In *nix, make sure you have a fast machine, such as a P4 with a decent amount of memory, otherwise D2GS will take forever to load.
<br><br>
Keep in mind though, that whether your running D2GS on Windows or *nix, it consumes a lot of memory.  D2GS will take 45 megs of RAM running all by itself without any uses connected.  As more users connect, it will consume more memory.  It would be best to run D2GS on a machine with lots of memory.
</p>
<p>D2GS can be downloaded at the following locations below, beta 7 being latest version (d2gs-109d-beta7.zip): 
<ol>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://streetwar.free.fr/" target="web"><b>Index of /</b></a>
</ul>
<br><br>

<li>Make sure D2CS & D2DBS or D2Closed isn't running.  If they are, shut them down.  To setup D2GS, first go back & edit the <b>d2cs.conf</b> file.  If your using D2Closed, then edit the <b>d2closed.conf</b> file & skip to step 3.  Scroll down to the <b>gameservlist</b> line & remove the <b>#</b> in front of it to enable this option.   Then, change it to look line the following:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>gameservlist &nbsp;=&nbsp; X.X.X.X</b>
<br>
Replace X.X.X.X with the IP address of the computer that D2GS will be running on.  This must be specific, 0.0.0.0 won't work.
</ul>
<br>
Save & close you text editor.
<br><br><br>

<li>Now, edit the <b>d2dbs.conf</b> file.  Basically, you'll be doing the same thing that you did above to this file.  Scroll down to the <b>gameservlist</b> line & remove the <b>#</b> in front of it to enable this option.  Then, change it to look line the following:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>gameservlist &nbsp;=&nbsp; X.X.X.X</b>
<br>
Replace X.X.X.X with the IP address of the computer that D2GS will be running on.  This must be specific, 0.0.0.0 won't work.
</ul>
<br>
Save & close you text editor.

<br><br><br>
<li>Finally, you can move on to setting up D2GS:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Download d2gs-109d-20030304.zip
<br><br>
<li>Unzip it & move all of it's contents to a path that you plan on keep D2GS on a permanent basis, such as in the PvPGN directory, in a sub-directory called D2GS, might be a good idea.
</ul>

<br><br>
<li>Insert your Diablo II CD(s) into your CD-ROM drive & copy all the Diablo II <b>.DLL</b> & <b>.MPQ</b> files to the directory where D2GS is located.  If you plan on also supporting/playing the expansion, Diablo II LOD, you will also need to copy all <b>.DLL</b> & <b>.MPQ</b> files from the Diablo II LOD CD as well.  
<br><br>
If you already have Diablo II or Diablo II LOD installed on the computer that D2GS will be running on, then copying all the DLL & MPQ files from the CD's aren't necessary.  Just put the D2GS program & related files in the directory where Diablo II is installed & run if from their. 

<br><br><br>
<li>Edit the <b>d2gs.reg</b> in a text editor such as Wordpad or Notepad.  To edit the <b>d2gs.reg</b> file without importing into the registry, simply:  
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Highlight the <b>d2gs.reg</b> file by placing your mouse over it or single clicking on it
<li>Right click the mouse button
<li>Left click on the <b>Edit</b> button
<li>The file should open it Wordpad or Notepad
<li>Change the settings to the information in the next step
</ul>

<br><br>
<li>Scroll down to the <b>D2CSIP</b> line.  Change it to the following: 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>"D2CSIP" &nbsp;=&nbsp; "X.X.X.X"</b>
<br>
Change X.X.X.X to the IP address of the computer running D2CS, or more appropriately put, to the IP address you defined in the <b>servaddrs</b> line, in the <b>d2cs.conf</b> file.
</ul>

<br><br>
<li>Now, scroll down to the <b>D2DBSIP</b> line.  Change it to the following: 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>"D2DBSIP" &nbsp;=&nbsp; "X.X.X.X"</b>
<br>
Change X.X.X.X to the IP address of the computer running D2DBS, or more appropriately put, to the IP address you defined in the <b>servaddrs</b> line, in the <b>d2dbs.conf</b> file.
</ul>
<br>
Leave the rest of the other settings alone.  Save & close your text editor.

<br><br><br>
<li>The <b>d2gs.reg</b> setting information needs to be imported into the registry.  Double/single click (depending on your Windows setup) on the <b>d2gs.reg</b> file.  When it asks you if you want to import this data into the Windows registry, simply answer <b>Yes</b>.

<br><br><br>
<li>For Windows XP, 2000, Me & NT, you might want to install D2GS as a service instead.  To do this simple run:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>install.bat</b>
</ul>
<br>
Then, to run the D2GS service, type <b>net start d2gs</b> at the command prompt or from the run prompt.  Windows 9x users, simply run <b>d2gs.exe</b> instead.

<br><br><br>
<li>As a recap, start D2CS, D2DBS & finally D2GS.  To start D2GS, just run the <b>d2gs.exe</b> file.  If your in Windows ME & up & installed D2GS as a service, simply type <b>net start d2gs</b> at the command prompt or from the run prompt.

<br><br><br>
<li>One last thing before you break out the campaign, is to check the D2GS status via Telnet.  To do this, make sure D2GS, D2DBS & D2GS are running.  Then:
<ul><br>
<li>Go to a DOS or command prompt.
<br><br>
<li>type <b>telnet X.X.X.X 8888</b>
<br><br>
Replace X.X.X.X with the IP address of the computer running D2GS.  By default, D2GS will automatically be listening on port 8888.  You may need to temporarily open port 8888 on the machine running D2GS if your behind a firewall.
<br><br>
<li>Use <b>abcd123</b> for the password when prompted.
<br><br>
<li>When at the telnet prompt, after connection, you may wish to change your password from the default abcd123 to something else.  To do this, type <b>passwd</b> at the telnet prompt, then change to password to something that you will remember.
<br><br>
<li>To check your D2GS status, simply type <b>status</b>.  This will tell you various information such as if D2GS is connected to D2CS & D2DBS, etc.
<br><br>
<li>For more telnet commands, simply type <b>help</b> at the telnet prompt.
</ul>
</li></ul>
</ol>
<b>All done, have fun!!!</b>

<H2><A NAME="INS-Q10">How do I setup tracking & what's it for?</A></H2>

The tracking server info overall is simple.  This sends your server information, such as your location, IP address, contact name, etc., which you can define in you bnetd.conf file, to a specific host.  By default, this information will be sent to the <a href="http://12.110.173.232/" target="web">PvPGN Server List</a>, which is a collection of other game servers (mainly PvPGN servers like yours) from all over the world.  This basically adds your server to the list for others to play their games on.  This is optional and can be disabled however is enabled by default.
<br><br>
To setup server tracking, edit your bnetd.conf file and go to the "Tracking Server Info" section:
<OL>
<li>The track setting is how often PvPGN will send your server information to the PvPGN Server List.  
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>track &nbsp;=&nbsp; 60</b>
<br>
This setup would send tracking info to the PvPGN Server List every 60 seconds.
<br><br>
<li><b>track &nbsp;=&nbsp; 0</b>
<br>
This setup would disable tracking info.
</ul>

<br><br>
<li>The trackaddrs defines where you want your server info to be sent to.  By default, it's sent to <b>track.pvpgn.org</b>, however you can change this to what ever server you want or even define multiple servers.  If you decide not to use track.pvpgn.org to display your tracking info, where you sent the info (such as to yourself...which you can do), you must have bntrackd running and accept incoming UDP packets on port 6114.  In most cases, it's best just to leave this as the default. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>trackaddrs &nbsp;=&nbsp; "track.pvpgn.org"</b>
<br>
This setup would send tracking info to track.pvpgn.org.
<br><br>
<li><b>trackaddrs &nbsp;=&nbsp; "track.pvpgn.org, localhost"</b>
<br>
This setup would send tracking info to track.pvpgn.org and the localhost (yourself).  Bntrackd would need to be running on localhost.
<br><br>
<li><b>trackaddrs &nbsp;=&nbsp; "X.X.X.X:6114"</b>
<br>
This setup would send tracking info to what ever IP address you define on port 6114 (replace X.X.X.X with your internet IP address or what ever IP address you want to send the tracking info to).  This also could be used to sent tracking info to yourself if you don't want to use localhost.  Bntrackd would need to be running on X.X.X.X.
<br><br>
</ul>

<br>
<li>This is pretty self explanatory.  This is the information your server would send to the about address for display.  Change the appropriate fields to match your location, contact name, etc. 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>location &nbsp;=&nbsp; "Digi_Gyrl's World"</b>
<br>
Where your server is located.
<br><br>
<li><b>description &nbsp;=&nbsp; "Digi_Gyrl's Game Server"</b>
<br>
What name you call your PvPGN server.
<br><br>
<li><b>url &nbsp;=&nbsp; "None"</b>
<br>
Put your website address here if you have one.
<br><br>
<li><b>contact_name &nbsp;=&nbsp; "Digi_Gyrl"</b>
<br>
Who is the contact for your PvPGN server.
<br><br>
<li><b>contact_email &nbsp;=&nbsp; "noway@yahoo.com"</b>
<br>
What's the contacts email address.
</li></ul>

<H2><A NAME="INS-Q11">How do I setup bntrackd & what's it for?</A></H2>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5px" align="justify">
The Bntrackd program receives stats information from bnetd based servers, interprets the data & dumps it into a text file.  From their, the perl script process.pl, located in the source under the scripts directory, converts the text dump to an html page.  Like the page seen at the <a href="http://track.pvpgn.org/" target="web">PvPGN Server List</a>.  Which intern, produces a stats page ranging from one to multiple game servers from all over the world.  It also includes valuable information such as game server uptime, users online, games in progress, etc.
<br><br>
If you want to send tracking info from bnetd to yourself, you will need to use bntrackd & have UDP port 6114 open.
</p>
<OL>
<li>In *nix based systems, go to where you installed PvPGN and go to the sbin directory.  Run:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>./bntrackd -o /usr/local/bin/bntrackd.txt -l /var/log/bnetd/bntrackd.log</b>
</ul>
<br>
The <b>-o</b> (which stands for output) tells bntrackd to dump it's incoming info to <b>/usr/local/bin/bntrackd.txt</b> and the <b>-l</b> (which stands for log) logs any errors to <b>/var/log/bnetd/bntrackd.log</b>

<br><br><br>
<li>Make sure trackaddrs in the bnetd.conf file is set to either localhost, your internet IP address, or your internal IP address.  Then, copy the <b>process.pl</b> from the source/scripts directory to a desirable path, make it executable and make sure the shebang path (example: #!/usr/bin/perl) is correct for the system your running on.  Edit the <b>process.pl</b> file, change 3 lines: 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>$infile &nbsp;=&nbsp; "/usr/local/bin/bntrackd.txt";</b>
<br>
This is the path you told bntrackd to dump it's data to.
<br><br>
<li><b>$outfile &nbsp;=&nbsp; "/var/www/html/bnetdlist.html";</b>
<br>
This is the path & name, where you want the html file to be produced.  If you want this accessible by others, it must be in a location readable from the internet.
<br><br>
<li><b>$tmpfile &nbsp;=&nbsp; "/tmp/bntrackd.tmp";</b>
<br>
This is the path where <b>process.pl</b> will place it's temporary file when running.
<br><br>
<li>type <b>perl process.pl</b>
</li></ul>
</ol>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5px" align="justify">
If all goes well, you should have a <b>bnetdlist.html</b> page in <b>/var/www/html</b>.  Then, setup a cron script to run the <b>process.pl</b> every few minutes or you could modify the perl script so it can be accessible directly from the internet and dump it's data directly to the screen rather than to an html file.  It also might be a good idea to add step 1 to your <b>rc.local</b> file, so bntrackd will load at boot time automatically.

<h1>General Questions</h1>

<H2><A NAME="GEN-Q1">What is a Diablo II Open Server & Diablo II Closed Server?</A></H2>

The answer to this question is overall simple.
<ol>
<li>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 25px" align="justify">
A <b>Diablo II Open Server</b> means that your character is <b>not</b> stored on PvPGN like on the real Battle.net.  When you play on Battle.net, your player is stored on their server.  In open Battle.net game play, your character is stored on your local computer instead.  This requires D2CS & D2DBS to be running in addition to PvPGN on the server side.  It has several advantages & disadvantages:
</p>

<b>Advantages:</b>
<ul>
<li>Single player character can be used to play on Battle.net.
<li>Backups can be made of your character in case your character file gets hosed or lost.
</ul>

<br>
<b>Disadvantages:</b>
<ul>
<li>Players can easily cheat.
<li>Trainers maybe used through out game play undetected.
<li>Admin has very little to no control over player's characters.
<li>Players can use hacks on their characters, weapons, armor, etc. to make them extremely powerful.
</ul>

<br>
To play on an <b>Open Battle.net Server</b>, simply:
<ul>
<li>Start <b>Diablo II</b> or <b>Diablo II LOD</b>.
<li>Select the <b>Gateway</b> of the machine you want to connect to.
<li>Click on the <b>Other Multiplayer</b> button.
<li>Click on the <b>Open Battle.net</b> button.
</ul>

<br><br>
<li>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 25px" align="justify">
A <b>Diablo II Closed Server</b> means that your character <b>is</b> stored on PvPGN just like the real Battle.net.  This requires D2CS, D2DBS & D2GS to be running in addition to PvPGN on the server side.  It has several advantages & disadvantages as well:
</p>

<b>Advantages:</b>
<ul>
<li>Hacks & trainers are much easier to detect.
<li>Players have a much harder time trying to cheat.
<li>The admin of the server has more control over player's characters.
</ul>

<br>
<b>Disadvantages:</b>
<ul>
<li>Single player characters cannot be used.
<li>Backups can't be made of your character by the player.
<li>Slow servers or bandwidth can cause lagging or additional wait time.
<li>Player is at the mercy of the admin, should the admin wish to delete your character.
<li>If you don't log in frequently, your account could be deleted, along with your character.
</ul>

<br>
To play on an <b>Closed Battle.net Server</b>, simply:
<ul>
<li>Start <b>Diablo II</b> or <b>Diablo II LOD</b>.
<li>Select the <b>Gateway</b> of the machine you want to connect to.
<li>Click on the <b>Battle.net</b> button.
</ul>

<br><br>
<li>You may run both an open & closed server at the same time.  The player, in such a situation, would then choose which game play they would like to use (open or closed).

<H2><A NAME="GEN-Q4">How do I give my account administrative privileges & what does this mean?</A></H2>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5px" align="justify">
In short, this means a user with administrative privileges can ban other players or delete their accounts within the Battle.net console.  Users with administrative privileges are indicated differently depending on what game you are playing.  For example, in Starcraft, their would be a small Blizzard logo by their name. In Diablo II, their text color is generally blue while everyone else's is white & their character will say "Blizzard Rep" when you place your mouse cursor over it.
<br><br>
The following only needs to be done to create the first administrative user.  Once that user has administrative privileges, they can give other players the same privileges, should he or she wish to, within the Battle.net console.  If you already have a user with administrative privileges & want to give another user the same privileges, skip to step 3 for further information.  If you installed PvPGN without MySQL support, it means you are using the flat files to store players account information & stats.  The user accounts are typically named by the users name.  The PVPGN database is not located here.
</p>
<ol>
<li>If you installed PvPGN without MySQL support: :
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Shutdown PvPGN.
<br><br>
<li>Find the name of the user you want to give administrative privileges in the path where you installed PvPGN, under the <b>var/users</b> sub-directory.
<br><br>
<li>Edit the file in a text editor & add the following lines to the beginning of the user account file.  Make sure they are the first lines in user account files or it wont work:
<ul>
<br>
<li><b>"BNET\\auth\\admin"="true"</b>
<br><br>
<li><b>"BNET\\auth\\operator"="true"</b>
</ul>
<br>
<li>Save & close your text editor.
<br><br>
<li>Start PvPGN.
</ul>

<br><br>
<li>If you installed PvPGN with MySQL support:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Shutdown PvPGN.
<br><br>
<li>Edit the PVPGN database.  <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/" target="web"><b>phpMyAdmin</b></a> is a good program to use to edit MySQL databases.
<br><br>
<li>Go to the <b>BNET</b> table in the database.
<br><br>
<li>Find the user account you want to give administrative privileges.
<br><br>
<li>Change the <b>auth</b> column from <b>false</b> to <b>true</b>.
<br><br>
<li>Apply the changes.
<br><br>
<li>Start PvPGN.
</ul>

<br><br>
<li>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 25px" align="justify">
Now that you have at least one user with administrative privileges, log in as that user & type the following to give administrative privileges to another user.  Only give this privilege to users you trust.  This privilege is <b>NOT</b> meant for everybody, just those that run or manage your PvPGN server.  All users are <b>NOT</b> given administrative privileges by default:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>/makeadmin jack</b>
<br>
This example would give the user <b>jack</b> administrative privileges.
</ul>
<br>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 25px" align="justify">
To remove administrative privileges, at the console type:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>/demoteadmin jack</b>
<br>
This example would remove the user <b>jack</b> administrative privileges.
</ul>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 25px" align="justify">
This works instantly when PvPGN is setup using MySQL.  If your running in file mode, PvPGN will need to be restarted for the changes to take effect.

<H2><A NAME="GEN-Q6">What's the difference between the Standard & Elite version of PvPGN?</A></H2>

This is unreal and will most likely be removed in the next FAQ update.  If your reading this section, it would be best to upgrade to the latest version of PvPGN, since their is know longer an "elite" version of PvPGN.
<br><br>
The "standard" & "elite" version are for Windows only.  For *nix based systems, just configure PvPGN properly before compiling it.  Here are some pros & cons to each setup: 

<br><br><br>
<ol>
<li>Standard version: 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>User accounts are stored via <b>flat files</b> under the var\users directory.
<br>
<li><b>SQL</b> support is unavailable in this version.
<br>
<li>No profiles, ranking, web stats support.
<br>
<li>May be slow starting/restarting PvPGN with lots of user accounts.
</ul>

<br><br>
<li>Elite version:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>User accounts are stored via an <b>SQL database</b>.
<br>
<li>Since elite stores it's data via SQL, profiles, rankings & web stats are available.
<br>
<li>PvPGN may be run as a service instead of as an application.
<br>
<li>With lots of users, this version starts/restarts faster.
<br>
<li>Making changes to user accounts are easier.
<br>
<li>If something happens to the database, all user accounts are lost, unless it's backed up.
<br>
<li>The prior version's database might be incompatible with new up-coming versions of PvPGN.  Which, in short, means loss of user accounts including their stats.  Example: MySQL database from PvPGN 1.1.5 may be incompatible or lack features for use with PvPGN 1.1.7.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5px" align="justify">
No, PvPGN will not work with Microsoft's SQL database programs which uses different call handlers.  Microsoft's programs are closed source & leading more & more towards proprietary software.  MySQL is open source & hopefully will remain that way, which is why so many open source programs use MySQL. <a href="http://www.mysql.com" target="web">Download</a> & install MySQL...it's free & works on Windows or *nix based systems.

<H2><A NAME="GEN-Q8">How do I create my own entries in the versioncheck file?</A></H2>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5px" align="justify">
This information was supplied by a user who would like to remain anonymous.  This information has been altered from it's originality.  The original can be viewed <a href="originals/anatomy_of_a_PvPGN_versioncheck.txt">here</a>.  Remember, PvPGN does <b>NOT SUPPORT WAREZ</b> and that this information is supplied for legitimate purposes only. 
<br><br>
Since PvPGN has it's own built in debugger, making versioncheck changes/addition are fairly easy.  Before doing anything, it might be a good idea to backup your original versioncheck file before altering it.  If you run into a bind, you can easy just overwrite the modified versioncheck with the backup of the original.
</p>
<br>

<ol>
<li>Edit the <b>bnetd.conf</b> file & change the <b>loglevel</b> settings to:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>loglevels &nbsp;=&nbsp; info,fatal</b>
<br>
</ul>
</li>
<br>
Save & close your text editor, then restart PvPGN.


<br><br><br>
<li>Connect to PvPGN with the game you wish to write the versioncheck entry for, such as Warcraft III.

<br><br><br>
<li>Check your bnetd log & look for two entires, that begin with:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>versioncheck_validate</b>
<br>
and
<br>
<li><b>CLIENT_AUTHREQ</b>
</ul>
</li>

<br>
<table>
<b>Example exert taken from the bnetd log:</b>
<br>
Aug 01 11:57:49 handle_bnet_packet: [516] <b>CLIENT_AUTHREQ_109</b> ticks=0x515ad5fb, verstr=1.0.1.1 exeinfo="war3.exe 07/10/02 18:59:10 713495" versionid=0x00000001 gameversion=0x01000101 checksum=0x062ef7dc
<br>
Aug 01 11:57:49 <b>versioncheck_validate</b>: got a matching entry: WAR3
</table>

<br><br>
<li>Edit the <b>versioncheck</b> file & scroll down to almost the bottom of the file.  You should see several versioncheck entries, like the sample below.  Duplicate one of the versioncheck entries by using copy & paste.  This will be the entry that you'll be changing.  This will act as a sudo template so the format is all correct.
<br><br>
This versioncheck entry is for Warcraft III.  If your going to create an entry, for such as Starcraft, then simply duplicate an already existing Starcraft entry & alter it instead.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b># Warcraft III Retail 1.01
<br>
"A=3845581634 B=880823580 C=1363937103 4 A=A-S B=B-C C=C-A A=A-B" \
<br>

<br>
1.0.1.0 \
<br>
0x62c2e1a2 \
<br>
WAR3</b>
</ul>
</li>

<br><br>
<li>Now it's time to change the sudo template.  Go to the bnetd log file & use the information from the <b>versioncheck_validate</b> & <b>CLIENT_AUTHREQ</b> lines, as described in step 3.  To make this easier, it has been broken into phases for each line.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b># Warcraft III Retail 1.01b</b>
<br>
Change this to the description of the entry of your choice.  In this example, we where connecting with Warcraft III, version 1.01b.  
</ul>

<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>"A=3845581634 B=880823580 C=1363937103 4 A=A-S B=B-C C=C-A A=A-B" \</b>
<br>
Leave this entry alone.  It will work fine the way it is, regardless of version changes.  
</ul>
<br><br>

<ul>
<li><b>IX86ver1.mpq \</b>
<br>
Leave this entry alone.  It will work fine the way it is, regardless of version changes.  
</ul>
<br><br>

<ul>
<li><b>IX86 \</b>
<br>
Leave this entry alone.  It will work fine the way it is, regardless of version changes.  
</ul>
<br><br>

<ul>
<li><b>WAR3 \</b>
<br>
Change this to the <b>versioncheck_validate</b> in the bnetd log.  Ours said <b>versioncheck_validate: got a matching entry: WAR3</b>, so thats what we put for this entry.   
</ul>
<br><br>

<ul>
<li><b>"war3.exe 07/10/02 18:59:10 713495" \</b>
<br>
Change this to the <b>exeinfo</b> from the <b>CLIENT_AUTHREQ</b> in the bnetd log.  Ours said <b>exeinfo="war3.exe 07/10/02 18:59:10 713495"</b>, so thats what we put for this entry.   
</ul>
<br><br>

<ul>
<li><b>0x00000001 \</b>
<br>
Change this to the <b>versionid</b> from the <b>CLIENT_AUTHREQ</b> in the bnetd log.  Ours said <b>versionid=0x00000001</b>, so thats what we put for this entry.   
</ul>
<br><br>

<ul>
<li><b>1.0.1.1 \</b>
<br>
Change this to the <b>verstr</b> from the <b>CLIENT_AUTHREQ</b> in the bnetd log.  Ours said <b>verstr=1.0.1.1</b>, so thats what we put for this entry.   
</ul>
<br><br>

<ul>
<li><b>0x062ef7dc \</b>
<br>
Change this to the <b>checksum</b> from the <b>CLIENT_AUTHREQ</b> in the bnetd log.  Ours said <b>checksum=0x062ef7dc</b>, so thats what we put for this entry.   
</ul>
<br><br>

<ul>
<li><b>WAR3</b>
<br>
Leave this entry alone.  It will work fine the way it is, regardless of version changes.  
<br><br>
Save & close you text editor.  Change your <b>loglevels</b> back to what they where before & restart PvPGN.
</ul>

</ul>
</li>

<br><br>
<li>Now that your finished, here is what the versioncheck entry should look like this from step 5: 
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b># Warcraft III Retail v1.01b
<br>
"A=3845581634 B=880823580 C=1363937103 4 A=A-S B=B-C C=C-A A=A-B" \
<br>
IX86ver1.mpq \
<br>
IX86 \
<br>
WAR3 \
<br>
"war3.exe 07/10/02 18:59:10 713495" \ 
<br>
0x00000001 \                               
<br>
1.0.1.1 \                                  
<br>
0x062ef7dc \                         
<br>
WAR3</b>
</ul>
</li>

<br><br>
<li>You may create as many versioncheck entries for any game PvPGN supports.  Such as an entry for Warcraft III Retail version 1.01, 1.01b, etc.
</li>
</ol>

<br>
<b>Have Fun!!!</b>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; TEXT-INDENT: 0px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5px" align="justify">
Warcraft III is a bit different than the prior Blizzard games since they added some addition checking features to detour people from playing on non-official Blizzard Battle.net servers.  For this reason, Warcraft III requires a loader.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Update to the latest version of Warcraft III.  The latest update patch can be obtained from Blizzards website. 
<br><br>
<li>Go to the directory Warcraft III is installed & rename <b>blizzard.ax</b> to <b>blizzards.ax</b>
<br><br>
<li><a href="http://www.world-of-amadeus.de/" target="web">Download</a> & unzip the Adaptive AX loader into the directory Warcraft III is installed.
<br><br>
<li>Create a shortcut, such as on your desktop, that points to <b>War3.exe</b>
<br><br>
<li>Right click on the shortcut & select <b>Properties</b>
<br><br>
<li>Add <b>-pvpgn</b> to the <b>Target</b>.  So the <b>Target</b> should look something like this:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Target:&nbsp;&nbsp;"c:\games\warcraft III\War3.exe" -pvpgn</b>
</ul>
<br>
<li><a href="http://www.world-of-amadeus.de/" target="web">Download</a> & unzip the BNet Gateway Editor.  Add the game server you wish to connect to.  For a list of PvPGN servers to connect to go to the <a href="http://track.pvpgn.org/" target="web">PvPGN Server List</a> page. 
<br><br>
<li>To play back on Blizzard's Battle.net servers, simply run the original shortcut to Warcraft III or run <b>War3.exe</b> without the <b>-pvpgn</b> switch.

Heres a pretty good article supplied by an anonymous user on how to connect to Battle.net based servers when behind a gateway. This is useful for those that have multiple computers sharing one IP address, on one internet connection. This also should work for those behind hardware type gateways, like Linksys routers.  <a href="originals/network.pdf" target="web">Click Here</a> to view the article (it is in PDF format).

Make sure you edited the <b>bnetd.conf</b> file correctly.  Their are two possibilities as to what causes this:

<li>The servaddrs in the <b>bnetd.conf</b> is set incorrectly, make the <b>servaddrs</b> look like this:

This will tell PvPGN to listen on all IP addresses for port 6112.

or if you want PvPGN to listen only on a specific IP address, make the <b>servaddrs</b> look like this:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>servaddrs &nbsp;=&nbsp; "X.X.X.X:6112"</b>

<H2><A NAME="TRO-Q4">When compiling PvPGN with MySQL support, I get "checking for mysql_init  in -lmysqlclient... no".</A></H2>

Their are three possible solutions:
<ol>
<li>Try configuring PvPGN using the <b>--with-libraries</b> switch, then run make and make install:  
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>./configure --with-libraries="/usr/lib/mysql" --with-mysql</b>
</ul>

<br><br>
<li>If you installed MySQL via the rpm files...make sure you installed at least the following rpms:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>MySQL, MySQL-Client, MySQL-Shared</b>
<br>
Without MySQL-Shared*.rpm installed, you might get errors and PvPGN will refuse to compile.

<br><br>
<li>It's possible the problem is the version of MySQL shared libs your using.  The solution for this problem is creating symlinks of libmysqlclient.a and libmysqlclient.so.X.X.X to your standard lib directory (usually /usr/lib) and rebuilding your library cache (try running ldconfig).

<H2><A NAME="TRO-Q5">When I try to compile PvPGN, I get a "/bin/sh: autoheader: command not found" error.</A></H2>

Their is a high probability that <b>"autoheader"</b> isn't installed, make sure autoheader is installed.  If not, try checking your OS distribution or <a href="http://www.rpmfind.net" target="web">rpmfind.net</a> for the newest version.

<H2><A NAME="TRO-Q6">I'm having problems connecting to my PvPGN server.</A></H2>

This is typically caused by a firewall or router that is not setup properly:
<OL>
<li>Make sure you have at least port 6112 open for the TCP & UDP protocols on both the server side and client side if your behind a firewall.
<br><br>
<li>If your behind a router, make sure your router it is setup to forward the appropriate ports to your server, else register it in the router as a DMZ.  Be aware that if you register your computer as a DMZ in your router, it will be completely exposed to the internet, as if it were directly connected to the internet, without protection from the router.  In this setup, you will have no protection from intruders and some sort of firewall would be recommended.
<br><br>
Here are some good links on how to setup your router:
<ul>
<li><a href="originals/linksysguide.pdf" target="web"><b>Linksys Router Setup for Warcraft 3</b></a>
<li><a href="originals/The-Warcraft-III-Pub.htm" target="web"><b>Battle.net Router/Firewall Configuration</b></a> (Mirror)

</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li>If your trying to connect using Warcraft III, make sure you are using the binary (exe) loader or the AX loader.  Also, make sure your using the correct version loader for the version game your trying to connect with.  Example - The loader for Warcraft III version 1.01 wont work with Warcraft III version 1.02.
<br><br>
<li>If your trying to connect using the same computer that your running the server on, you will probably get a connection error.  This really depends on what OS your running on.  In Windows XP, probably Windows 2000 as well, you can connect a client to a server on the same computer without any problems, however you will be unable to create games, just join them and PG/AT wont work either.  This arrangement probably will not work on Windows 98 and earlier. 
<br><br>
<li>If all else fails, check your log files.  Most of the time, something in one of the config files are set incorrectly which is causing your connection problems.  If you are still unable to connect to your PvPGN server, try logging on to <a href="irc://irc.pvpgn.org">irc.pvpgn.org</a>, channel #pvpgn.  Someone their might be able to assist you.

<H2><A NAME="TRO-Q7">I changed the .pcx banner file, yet in Warcraft III the banner didn't change.</A></H2>

The .pcx graphic file located in the var/files directory only appears in Starcraft & Starcraft Brood War.  It will not appear in Warcraft III in the .pcx graphic format.  Convert the .pcx file to an animated .mng file, then it will show up in Warcraft III.  Make sure to make the appropriate changes to the <b>ad.list</b> file in the <b>/etc</b> directory.  I'm unsure as to whether or not you still need the .pcx graphic file or not, but I don't think you need both, just the .mng file.  Try using both the .pcx & .mng files & see what happens.

<H2><A NAME="TRO-Q8">In the PHP stats, I get "Call to undefined function: mysql_connect() in /pvpgn-stats/mysql_handler.php line 7".</A></H2>

This error occurs when PHP is not compiled with MySQL support.  Compile PHP using the <b>--with-mysql</b> switch or install the php-mysql*.rpm file if your systems uses the rpm files, such as RedHat Linux distributions.

<H2><A NAME="TRO-Q9">When running PvPGN, I get "server_set_name: could not get hostname: No error".</A></H2>

Here is an confirmed post by Gybrush that fixes this.
<br>
<ol>
<li>Edit the <b>bnetd.conf</b> file & scroll down to the <b>"Server Network Info"</b> section.  Add the following under the <b>w3routeaddr</b>:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>servername &nbsp;=&nbsp; "localhost"</b>
<br>
Change the <b>servername</b> entry to the name of your computer.  <b>Localhost</b> would probably be a good choice since it's indigenous to most operating systems.
</ul>
</li>

It is possible that your using the wrong loader or no loader at all.  When hosting a PvPGN server, double check it's log files.  It's amazing how one little stupid thing can cause hours of head aches.  Partically, when trying to connect multiple computers and hosting a PvPGN server, via one shared internet connection.

<H2><A NAME="TRO-Q11">When running PvPGN with MySQL support under Windows, I get a bunch of database errors.</A></H2>

If your getting an error like this:
<br><br>
<b>[error] db_get_attributes: could not read a field name<br>
[error] storage_attr_getfirst: could not retrieve attribute list<br>
[error] account_load_attrs: could not open account (storage) "0"<br>

[error] storage_account_getfirst: could not get the account list<br>
[error] accountlist_create: unable to start users read</b><br><br>

It's likely your libMySQL.dll file is causing the problem.  Check the created date and file size of your libMySQL.dll file by right clicking on the file and left clicking on <b>Properties</b>.  LibMySQL.dll, created 2002-10-10 and file size 233,472 bytes has been confirmed to work just fine.
