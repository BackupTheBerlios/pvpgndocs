<blockquote>
      <p>  It's great to have server to play on that is your own or used by a group
  of friends, you can have your own local competitions, tournaments etc. Having
  a server is one thing, getting people to connect to it is another.<br>
  <br>
  Out of the box, games like WarCraft, StarCraft etc have the Blizzard servers
  listed that users can connect to and there is no interface provided that lets
  users edit this information. Fortunately the internet community has gathered
  together and produced some small tools that let you edit this information and
  allow you to list more servers than just the Blizzard ones.<br>
  <br>
  These default settings must be edited before a user can connect to your server.<br>

  <p>The macintosh Battle.Net gateway editor has been updated recently. It allows you to easily edit the Battle.Net gateway servers list, select the default server and re-order the list of servers available.</p>
  <p>You will need to find MacBNetGatewayEditor v0.4. Earlier versions are available with reduced functionality. Version 0.4 has been compiled with support for Mac OS X 10.2 and Mac OS X 10.3. </p>

<p><strong>How to play Starcraft on a Mac when the Mac is the PvpGN Server<a name="SvrMac"></a> </strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This primary issue here is that you want to use you Mac as a PvPGN server and you want to use the same Mac to play the game, i.e. Starcraft / Broodwar. However behind the scenes the PvPGN server is using port 6112 which is the same port that Starcraft / Broodwar wants to use. This results in users getting messages such as &quot;latency is too high&quot;. </p>
  <p>To fix this issue, you need to change the port that Starcraft / Broodwar is using. You do that by editing the file &quot;Battle.net Preferences&quot;. <em><strong>Warning. Backup this file BEFORE making any changes. </strong></em>The file cannot be edited with a simple text editor. You will need ResEdit or ResFool to perform this function. This edit can be performed under OS X.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
  <li>Using ResEdit or ResFool open the file &quot;users/&lt;your username&gt;/Library/Preferences/Battle.net Battle.net Preferences&quot;</li>
  <li>Add a new HKEY resource with the name "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Battle.net\Configuration\Game Data Port". The data values you add need to go in as per the following example: &quot;0000 0004 0000 3F48&quot; where 3F48 is a hex value of the decimal port number. </li>

<p><strong>Loosing Battle.net (TM) preferences for Mac OS 9?<a name="os9battle"></a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&gt; It seems that the new StarCraft v1.11b checks if the file &quot;Battle.net Preferences&quot; 
 &gt; was edited by someone else. Everytime I startup StarCraft, it resets my newly added Gateways. </pre>
  <p>    Is this you? Well some analysis by &quot;Cassiel&quot; came up with this answer...<br>
    <br>
    I tested this on a German Mac OS X 10.3.4 with an US-Version of Starcraft: BroodWar  
  and applied Patch 1.11b.</p>
  <p> It seems that StarCraft only resets this file if the length of the resource where the 
    Gateways are store is bigger than 125. All entries below this length are working 
  perfectly. It also happens if you try to add a new gateway.</p>
  <p> I locked the resource entry through Resorcerer and it worked, but after a new restart 
    of Stacraft the program also writes the gateways to the file &quot;Starcraft preferences&quot;, 
    now I have two gateway resource-entries, one in &quot;Battle.net preferences&quot; and the other 
    one in &quot;Starcraft preferences&quot;. If these gateways differs, Starcraft is loads up the 
    default hard-coded settings somewhere in the program. It also uses the default gateways <br>
    if you change the permission on this file to &quot;read only&quot;. Strange thing!<br>
    <br>
&gt; The solution?<br>
    <br>
    Why not delete the gateways you do not intend to use and add in the gateway you want 
  to use. This will keep you entries &lt;125 (bytes?)</p>

<p><strong>      Playing on a PvPGN server from behind a router<a name="router"></a> </strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>How can I have more than one SC/BW client behind a router?<br>
    The detail for this question has been taken directly from the FAQ section at <a href="http://forums.pvpgn.org">http://forums.pvpgn.org</a><br>
    Answer c/- aaron<br>
    <br>
    When you wanna play SC/BW games with more than one user behind the same router.. it won't work.... 
    here is the solution... 
  for each gaming PC behind the router do this:</p>
  <pre>  a. use regedit to edit/create:
     HKLM\Software\Battle.net\Configuration REG_DWORD &quot;Game Data Port&quot;
     (choose a unique so far unused port for each client)
  b. Then on your router forward each of those ports to the correct client computer... 
     (UDP, not sure if TCP needed)</pre>

  How to create a windows .reg file for user access to my server<a name="windowsreg"></a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You've got an PvPGN server running on LAN and want to give your &quot;buddies&quot;
    a .reg file because cause it's this way easier for them to get onto your 
    server.<br>
    <br>
    Register your server on another machine with one of the gateway Gateway 
    Editors and export following keys to the reg-file:</p>
  <pre>     [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Battle.net\Configuration]
 &quot;Server List&quot;
 &quot;Diablo II Battle.net gateways&quot; // for Diablo II
 &quot;Battle.net gateways&quot; // for Starcraft
     [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Battle.net\Configuration]
 &quot;Server List&quot;
     [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Blizzard Entertainment\Warcraft III]
 &quot;Battle.net gateways&quot; // for War III</pre>
  <pre>&nbsp;
