<p><b><a name="intro">Introduction</a></b></p>
  <blockquote>
        <p>PvPGN Banners are displayed at the top of the screen when chatting on Battle.net (TM)
	or a PvPGN server.  The real Battle.net (TM) uses these for commercial advertisements, 
	but you can use them for whatever you want!<br>
	<br>
	By default, there are ads for PvPGN displayed here which link to the PvPGN 
        website, but by following the instructions below, you can easily create your 
	own banners to display in this space.<br>
	<br>
	Unfortunately, Blizzard uses some very strange image formats, which makes this 
	not as easy as it sounds.</p>
  </blockquote>
<p><b><a name="formats">Graphic Formats</a></b></p>
  <blockquote>
	<p>The formats that are supported are PCX, MNG, and SMK.  These are the only 
	known formats that are supported by the Blizzard clients. For animated 
	banners, you must use the SMK (Smacker) format or MNG format. The actual 
	size of the images MUST be 468x60 pixels or the image will not display</p>
	<ul>
        <li> *.mng only works for Warcraft III</li>
	<li> *.pcx reportedly works for Starcraft, though we haven't got one to work yet</li>
	<li> *.smk is known to work for Starcraft and Diablo.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There is however a catch, there's always a catch. PvPGN does not ship with 
	"*.pcx" files. A "*.pcx" banner displayed in StarCraft will look like a 
random selection of colours unless you restrict your colour selection to 
64 colours starting at colour number 32. How do you do that to a PCX file? We don't know. </p>
	<p> Most graphics programs can create a *.pcx file, if you're looking for some freeware to do this, use <i>The Gimp</i> which is available for all platforms: <a href="http://www.gimp.org" target="_blank">http://www.gimp.org</a>      </p>
	<p>"*.smk" files are considered to be better than the other 
	      formats by the developers and supported by all clients. They don't 
	      have palette limitations and they compress better. Though just to add to 
    the effort required here, no normal graphics program can produce a "*.smk" file.</p>
	<p>For Diablo it appears as though the smk file will need to contain multiple frames (210 for example and all the same image). The good news here is that it compresses really well. <br>
      <br>
      So your best output format is "*.smk" but how do you produce it?<br>
      You need "SmackerTools":<br>
      - It's free! (Phew!)<br>
      - It only runs on Windows (ugg!)<br>
      - It is really important to use the <b>OLD</b> version of SmackerTools</p>
	<p><strong>Very important</strong>. The current version of RadTools for generating Smacker files will 
      only generate smacker files that will display in a Mac.<br>
    </p>
	<p>For full functionality, you must use an older version of the RadTools. Download it from </p>
	<p><a href="http://www.radgametools.com/smkdown.htm">http://www.radgametools.com/smkdown.htm</a>, look for &quot;The Old Smacker Tools&quot;</p>
    <p>      Download SmackerTools from:<br>
      <a href="http://www.radgametools.com/down/Smacker/SmkTools.exe">http://www.radgametools.com/down/Smacker/SmkTools.exe</a><br>
      <br>
      SmackerTools can take many different filetypes as input. Try it and see 
    what works best for you. Also have a read of the SmackerTools FAQ on their web site.</p>

<p><b><a name="prepare">Preparation</a></b></p>
  <blockquote>
	<p><ol>
	  <li>
	Get hold of a graphical editor, "Paint Shop Pro", "Photoshop", almost 
	anything.   I have used Paint Shop Pro (<a href="http://www.jasc.com/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.jasc.com/index.html</a>). It has excellent support for manipulating color 
	pallets (save, load, etc) on Windows.<br>
	<br>
	Jasc Paint Shop Pro 8 also includes an Animation Editor. You access it from 
	the File / Jasac Software Products menu. Select Jasac Anamination Shop. 
	This is the only program I know at the moment that will generate &quot;*.mng&quot; files. Remember you need to create &quot;*.mng&quot; files for Warcraft.<br>
	<br>
	How do you generate *.mng files under Mac OS X, any know? Please help. <br>
	<br>
	</li>
	  <li>
	Find your ad.conf file.  This will be in your "etc" directory (Linux) or 
	your "conf" directory (Windows). Read it carefully. Notice that you have ad000001.smk and ad000001.mng (one will display on StarCraft) and the other exclusively for Warcraft)<br>
	<br>
      </li>
	  <li>
	READ THE HELP TEXT at the beginning of the ad.conf file!

<p><b><a name="smack">Smack your banner into shape</a></b></p>
  <blockquote>
	<p>From the main screen of the RAD Video Tools, highlight the animation that 
	you want to convert, and click the "SmackIt" button at the bottom of the 
	window. Once the RAD Compressor window opens, you'll be able to tell SmackerTools what colour range to use. </p>
	<p><strong>Creating a banner with a single frame </strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Enter <strong>64</strong> (even though I've used 63 in the example) in the "To Use:" field of 
	  the Palette area on the screen</li>
    <li>Enter <strong>32 </strong>(even though I've used 33 in the example)  in the "To begin at:" field</li>
    <li>Also 
	    make sure that "<strong>create ring</strong>" is checked</li>
    <li> Click the Smack button to
	      convert your graphic. </li>

      You have the option of converting a single image into a single converted file or 
	      converting multiple files into a single smacker file. I'll leave you to 
        figure out how to do that.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Creating your banner with multiple frames</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>To create smk files with a number of frames (all based on the same image) do the following:</li>
    <li>      Create a &quot;*.lst&quot; file for smacker, so we'll call it advert.lst</li>
    <li>      Inside this file (it's just text) we'll provide a file name and some parameters, e.g. &quot;E:\pvpgn\files\ad000001.psd /L210&quot;. All this information goes on one line. You can have multiple entries on successive lines that will combine together to create one smacker file.</li>
    <li>      Back in SmackerTools, select the graphic processor tab, ensure that you filter the list of files on the left so that it just lists &quot;.lst&quot; files. Select your list file and click convert. SmackerTools will do its stuff. It may take 30 seconds, it may take 10 minutes. The duration depends on the complexity of your graphics and how many entries are in your list. The output from the convert process is *.flc (refer screen shot)</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="http://pvpgndocs.berlios.de/Old_smacker_3.jpg"></p>
    <p>      Convert the *.flc file into a *.smk file. (refer screen shot) and you're done. <br>

    <p>Oh, want to add sound? You need some WAV files. Then use the Mixer tab and add the sound.<br>

  <p><b><a name="add">Add the new banner to your server</a></b></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><ol>
	  <li>
	Place your graphic file in the "files" directory on your server, make sure you 
	follow the file naming conventions.<br>
	<br>
	</li>
	  <li>
	Edit the ad.conf file making sure your follow the format.  See the comments 
	at the beginning of ad.conf to help you.  The text below is an example only!<br>
	<pre>"ad000001.smk"  init    30 "http://www.yourwebsite.org"      0x000002  "SEXP"
"ad000002.smk"  start   30 "http://www.yourwebsite.org"      0x000003  "SEXP"
"ad000003.smk"  norm    30 "http://www.yourwebsite.org"      0x000002  "SEXP"
</pre>
	<strong>Special note for WarCraft entries<br>
	</strong>Entries in ad.conf can only be of type &quot;init&quot; and are randomly chosen, thus if you have more than one banner to display you must have them in 
separate files and separate entries in the ad.conf file. <em>This might be a bug or by design?</em> <br>
<br>
&quot;*.mng&quot; files with multiple images do work but seem to have a timing limitation 
that cannot be influenced by the timer in ad.conf<br>
<br>

	  </li>
	  <li>
	Note the last column. This column will restrict display of this new advertisement 
	to the specific client gametag. So in this case Starcraft:Broodwar. Setting this 
	to "NULL" will show this banner to all clients that DON'T already have a 
	client-specific banner<br>
	<br>
	  </li>
	</ol>

  <blockquote>
	<p>You can save banners from Battle.net (TM) by using bnftp.  bnftp is included in the 
	PvPGN source tarball.  You will need to know the exact filename.<br>
	<br>
	Sound encoding is possible with the SMK format. As to if the clients will play 
	the sound, well you experiment and tell us.</p>
