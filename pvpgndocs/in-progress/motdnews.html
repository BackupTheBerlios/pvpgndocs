  <blockquote>
	<p>conf/bnmotd.txt contains the greeting that is sent to users when they connect<br>
	to your PvPGN server. You can customise that greeting by editing the file.<br>
	<br>
	The PvPGN distribution package comes with the following text in the<br>
	conf/bnmotd.txt file.<br>
	<br>
	<pre>%IHello %l, welcome to a PvPGN Server!
%IRunning version %v on %h.
%IThis server is hosted by %H
%I
%IThere are %a user accounts on this server.
%IThere are currently %U users in %G games of %N,
%Iand %u users playing %g games and chatting in %c channels.
%IHaving trouble with a command?  Type   /help   to
%Ilearn more about it.
%I
%I%m</pre>
	<br>
	You can customise the message that is sent to users. The only rule is<br>
	that all lines must start with %I. After that use what ever text you<br>
	like. You can also use the following parameters to further customise<br>
	your message.<br>
	<br>
	The parameters you can use here are:<br>
	<br>
	%a = number of registered accounts on the server<br>
	%c = number of currently existant channels<br>
	%g = total number of currently running games<br>
	%G = games of users with same clienttag.<br>
	%h = hostname of the server<br>
	%H = contact name (as set in bnetd.conf)<br>
	%i = userid of the user<br>
	%l = username<br>
	%N = name of the game the user has connected with.<br>
	%m = check user's mail when they login<br>
	%r = IP of the user<br>
	%t = clienttag of the user<br>
	%u = number of users currently logged in<br>
	%U = users logged in with the same clienttag<br>

	<p>Unfortunatly this is hardcoded, but anyone with some basic programming<br>
	skills can change this... just open src/bnetd/handle_bnet.c and at line<br>
	2791 you will find the hardcoded MOTD <img src="http://pvpgndocs.sourceforge.net/smile.gif"></p>
