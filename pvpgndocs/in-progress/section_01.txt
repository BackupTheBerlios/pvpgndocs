Section 1 - Introduction
 
What is PvPGN?
    Is software that emulates the Blizzard battle.net server. It is a modification
    of the bnetd server which aims to provide support for all Blizzard clients.
    It gives you the power to run your own server, manage your own users, 
    run your own tournaments etc. 
    
    The PvPGN ( or Player versus Player Gaming Network ) is a bnetd based gaming 
    network server emulation project. It currently supports all Battle.Net clients,
    such as StarCraft, Diablo II, and Warcraft III. The list of supported clients 
    and their minimum verion required is:
        - Diablo 1 v1.09
        - Starcraft v1.08
        - BroodWar v1.08
        - Warcraft II Battle.Net Edition v2.05
        - Diablo 2 v1.10
        - Diablo 2 LOD v1.10
        - Warcraft III Reign Of Chaos v1.13
        - Warcraft III Frozen Throne v1.13

    You can play games that are restricted to your local LAN or put your PvPGN 
    server on the Internet. It puts you as a "System Administrator" in control.
    Use a PvPGN server to host your own LAN parties or put the server online
    and on the internet for everyone. You can run Tournaments, have your own
    local competition ladders. The power is in your hands.
    
    PvPGN is a SourceForge project and can be accessed at
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/pvpgn

About this guide
    This guide has been created as a documentation project for PvPGN. Our intention
    is to bring together the current knowledge on setting up and running a PvPGN
    server and to provide details on how the clients can connect.
    
    This documentation project is not a commercial venture, nor has it been done
    for financial gain (though admitedly that would be nice). It has been put
    together by volunteers who are just trying to "do their bit".
    
    Q. Can you help?
    A. Yes - read this guide
    
    If you have encountering an administration issue or your clients are having
    operational issues then see if that scenario has been covered in this guide.
    If after doing this you still doing have a working solution, then post a
    message to the pvpgn forums at http://forums.pvpgn.org
    
    If a resolution for your issue has been found, we would appreciate your help
    by documenting the issue and the resolution so that this guide can be updated.
    Usually the message forum text can be used with some editing, we'd appreciate
    you doing this. Don't worry, we'll fix up any bad english or speeling erros.
    
    Our intention has been to write this guide relative to PvPGN 1.7, if you have
    an earlier release then your question may be answered here. We of course would
    prefer that you updated your copy of the software to the latest release.
    
    Finally a big thank you to the PvPGN Developers and you our supporters, and of
    course Blizzard.
    

System Requirements    
    The latest list of PvPGN supported platforms can be found in the docs
    directory of a PvPGN release docs/PORTS. As of 1.7 the following table
    shows the compatability.

    Architecture | Operating System | Status  | Comments
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    x86          | Linux 2.4.x      | OK      | main development platform
    x86          | Linux 2.6.x      | OK      | tested
    x86          | WIN32            | OK      | tested
    x86          | FreeBSD 4.x      | OK      | tested
    x86          | FreeBSD 5.x      | OK      | tested but use 5.2.1 at least
    x86          | BeOS R4 /w BONE  | OK      | tested
    x86          | OpenBSD 3.x      | OK      | tested
    x86_64/AMD64 | Linux 2.6.x      | OK      | tested (pvpgn >= 1.6.3 required)
    sparc64      | SunOS 5.9        | OK      | tested
    PowerPC G3   | Mac OS X 10.2.x  | OK      | tested
    PowerPC G3   | Mac OS X 10.3.x  | OK      | tested
    PowerPC G4   | Mac OS X 10.2.x  | OK      | tested
    PowerPC G4   | Mac OS X 10.3.x  | OK      | tested

    Clearly x86 is the most tested version. The platforms/operating systems not
    listed have not been tested or they did not come to the developers attention
    however, any POSIX system should work.

    If you have an operating PvPGN server on a platform/OS not listed above then
    please report it to the developers via the forums at http://forums.pvpgn.org
    
    The number of concurrent users you are likely to have on your server,
    in combination with the operating system will dictitate the host machine
    specifications.
    
    For example:
      * 666MHz PIII 256MB Windows XP
              estimate 10 concurrent users (limit unknown) 
              runs PvPGN permanemtly in background
      * iMac 400MHz <ram>MB Mac OS 10.3
      
      * ???   LINUX

Reporting Problems and or Bugs
    Sometimes things just don't make sense and are just too hard to nut out.
    Perhaps someone else has had the same problems and reported it? One great source
    of information and people to help is available at http://forums.pvpgn.org 
    here you can post questions where there's a good chance your questions will 
    be answered and you'll be on your way again.
    
    HOWEVER - there are some guidelines to using the forums. Most notably is the
              "don't post questions that have been answered before" and so
              you are encouraged to use the search feature of the forums.
    
    If you've read this documentation, and searched the forums, and you still
    are unable to get resolution for your problem then it's time to post a message
    to the forums. Try "Open Tech Support" first.
    
    Guidelines for posting messages
    It is a good idea to provide revalant information for your question like 
    the following:
    
    1. Where is the PvPGN server, internal LAN?
    2. How many players on internal LAN?
    3. How many players on external LAN?
    4. Details from the revalent configuration file (not the whole file)
    5. Short extracts from the bnetd.log file
    6. Software versions that are being used, both server and client.
