Introduction


Pre-Install decisions (Files, CDB, MySQL)

   <mark - need to fit your stuff into here too>

   As I recall the installation on windows prompts you for how you want to handle your data files.
   Somehow I ended up running with CDB. This wasn't really a problem until I wanted to edit some
   attributes of my users. I though that the user files were just text. I was WRONG.
   
   bnetd.conf has quite a bit of self documentation about altering the server configuration
   to support files, cdb, or mysql. I guess that larger installations would be wise to run 
   with a mysql database for performance, while at the low end of the scale, "files" will
   work but performance wont be the best.
   
   I switched to files so that I could edit the user files. Hey, I was trying to get ladder
   games to work (turned out to be a server bug / client version issue), and get "real"
   administrator access to the server.
   
   - cbd - editing user data
     Stored in var/userscdb
     The windows version ships with a program called cbd_tool.exe You can use this to 
     edit your user files if you have the need.
     
   - files - editing user data
     Stored in var/users
     No special tools required, a text editor is brilliant.
     
   - What does the contents of a user file look like?
     "Record\\SEXP\\0\\last game result"="DRAW"
     "profile\\location"="GRAGAH"
     "BNET\\acct\\lastlogin_ip"="192.168.10.193"
     "Record\\SEXP\\0\\draws"="28"
     "Record\\SEXP\\0\\last game"="29643220 212508874"
     "BNET\\acct\\lastlogin_clienttag"="SEXP"
     "BNET\\acct\\lastlogin_owner"="Grant"
     "BNET\\acct\\passhash1"="[removed]"
     "BNET\\acct\\username"="Grant"
     "BNET\\acct\\lastlogin_time"="1087187841"
     "Record\\SEXP\\0\\losses"="7"
     "Record\\SEXP\\0\\wins"="14"
     "Record\\SEXP\\1\\rank"="2"
     "Record\\SEXP\\1\\high rating"="1000"
     "Record\\SEXP\\1\\rating"="975"
     "BNET\\acct\\userid"="3"
     "Record\\SEXP\\1\\last game result"="LOSS"
     "Record\\SEXP\\1\\high rank"="2"
     "Record\\SEXP\\1\\losses"="1"
     "Record\\SEXP\\1\\last game"="29642988 164423556"

   - The default user file - but wait there's more
     Take a look in the conf directory. There are 2 default user files.
     I believe that only one is used based on your setup in bnetd.conf
     I have no idea how this works for mysql.
     
     bnetd_default_user.cdb - you can't view this with a text editor
     bnetd_default_user.txt - view with a text editor
     
     Using bnetd_default_user.txt as an example, if a value is set in this file
     the same value does not need to be set in the users actual data file.
     
     So if you want o make everyone admins ahve have access to ALL server commands
     ensure that these lines are uncommented.
     "BNET\\auth\\admin"="true"
     "BNET\\auth\\command_groups"="255"
     Don't leave things like this unless you TRUST everyone. Have these lines
     only in the user files of the real admins.

     MySQL Cross Platform Compatabilty, Mac OS X to Windows DB's?
    - text and reply extracted from forum post.

    POST - Gambit642
    My Mac (G3 900mhz; 40GB HD 7200; 1GB PC100 Memory) kills my
    PC (Intel 3.2Ghz Extreme Ed. 2MB Cache; 40GB 7200GB; 1GB DDR PC4200)
    in PvPGN performance and server-end response time. There are also security 
    conserns when the server goes public, so I want to make it Mac.

    So I want to host as many services as I can on the Mac. Can the DB's directory 
    in MySQL for OS X be copied over to the Windows MySQL directory and work? 
    What about the other way? Can PvPGN be hosted on a Mac and connect to MySQL on 
    a WinXP box?

    My recommendation would to be to have PvPGN and MySQL both running on the Mac. 

    Download MySQL for Mac here:
    http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-4.0/mysql-standard-4.0.20-apple-darwin7.3.0-powerpc.dmg/from/pick

    There is an excellent Mac-MySQL How-to here:
    http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2002/03/08/apache_mac_5.html

    And you can download PvPGN /w MySQL support for Mac here:
    http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pvpgn/pvpgn-1.6.3-1mysql.macos.ppc32.dmg?download

    Good luck, and finally there will be more than 2 Mac servers on the tracker
