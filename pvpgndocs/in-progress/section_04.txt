Introduction
    It's great to have server to play on that is your own or used by a group
    of friends, you can have your own local competitions, tournaments etc. Having
    a server is one thing, getting people to connect to it is another.
    
    Out of the box, games like WarCraft, StarCraft etc have the Blizzard servers
    listed that users can connect to and there is no interface provided that lets
    users edit this information. Fortunately the internet community has gathered
    together and produced some small tools that let you edit this information and
    allow you to list more servers than just the Blizzard ones.
    
    These default settings must be edited before a user can connect to your server.


How to set up Warcraft III to play on PvPGN servers
    You need a "loader and gateway editor".
    
    http://pvpgn-files.ath.cx/Warcraft III Roc & FT PvPGN Loader by Acid!.zip
    and a Battle.net Gateway editor
    http://pvpgn-files.ath.cx/BNGatewayEditor.exe
    --> look here for other things too... http://pvpgn-files.ath.cx

    1. Update to the latest version of Warcraft III. The latest update patch can 
       be obtained from Blizzards website. 

    2. Run the Battle.net gateway editor, make sure you select the WarCraft tab at
       at the bottom of the window, add the server you wish to connect to. Make it
       the default server if you wish.
       
    3. Download and install the WarCraft III loader simply copy the 2 files (exe and dll)
       to your Program Files folder, and run the exe.
       
    <these instructions may be a bit short. if you have a better set, I'd be happy to update>

    
How to set up Starcraft/Diablo/Diablo II to play on PvPGN
   - bnetconfig.exe (win32)
   - bnetse.dmg (Mac OS 10.3 image file)
     http://pvpgn.cyfx.net/files/MacBNetGatewayEditor-v0.3.dmg
     Note: I think version 0.2 worked under 10.2, but required some fiddling with resedit.

   Also, check out this site for additional PvPGN materials. http://pvpgn.cyfx.net/
   These programs allow you to edit the battle.net preferences files to provide additional servers
   i.e. your PvPGN server.
   
   Special notes for MAC users! - I needed these steps for Mac OS X 10.2. 
   May not be required for new software.
   StarCraft version was 1.10 at the time I believe.
   
   a. Run the Battle.net Server Editor program
   b. Add in your server, name, ipaddress, zone (actually timezone referenced to GMT)
   c. Save changes....  The file you have just updated is "<user>/Library/Preferences/Starcraft prefs"
   d. Backup this file
   e. Backup "battle.net Preferences" in the same folder
   f. Find ResEdit, run it
   g. Open both files
   h. In the Starcraft prefs file, copy the following resource 
      HKEY_CURRENT_USER/software/battle.net/configuration/battle.net gateways
   i. Paste this resource into the Battle.net preferences file (replacing the one currently there!!!)
   j Run StarCraft, connect to battle.net server

How to play on PvPGN servers with a Mac
  <Mark, I think you've got some doc for this!>

    Loosing Battle.net preferences for Mac OS 9?

    > It seems that the new StarCraft v1.11b checks if the file "Battle.net Preferences" 
    > was edited by someone else. Everytime I startup StarCraft, it resets my newly added Gateways.    
    
    Is this you? Well some analysis by "Cassiel" came up with this answer...
    
    I tested this on a German Mac OS X 10.3.4 with an US-Version of Starcraft: BroodWar 
    and applied Patch 1.11b.

    It seems that StarCraft only resets this file if the length of the resource where the 
    Gateways are store is bigger than 125. All entries below this length are working 
    perfectly. It also happens if you try to add a new gateway.

    I locked the resource entry through Resorcerer and it worked, but after a new restart 
    of Stacraft the program also writes the gateways to the file "Starcraft preferences", 
    now I have two gateway resource-entries, one in "Battle.net preferences" and the other 
    one in "Starcraft preferences". If these gateways differs, Starcraft is loads up the 
    default hard-coded settings somewhere in the program. It also uses the default gateways 
    if you change the permission on this file to "read only". Strange thing!
    
    > The solution?
    
    Why not delete the gateways you do not intend to use and add in the gateway you want 
    to use. This will keep you entries <125 (bytes?)

Where can I find a server to play on?

   A dynamic list of live servers is maintained on the internet. You can get there
   by visiting http://www.pvpgn.org and clicking on the link to "Live Servers". This
   link is to http://pvpgn.mivabe.nl and contains over 800 servers. Information such as
   IP address, URL, Host name, current number of online users, current number of online
   games is also listed.

Playing on a PvPGN server from behind a router 

   How can I have more than one SC/BW client behind a router?
   The detail for this question has been taken directly from the FAQ section at http://forums.pvpgn.org
   Answer c/- aaron
   
   When you wanna play SC/BW games with more than one user behind the same router.. it won't work....
   here is the solution... 
   for each gaming PC behind the router do this:

   a. use regedit to edit/create:
      HKLM\Software\Battle.net\Configuration REG_DWORD "Game Data Port"
      (choose a unique so far unused port for each client)
   b. Then on your router forward each of those ports to the correct client computer... 
      (UDP, not sure if TCP needed)

      
How to create a windows .reg file for user access to my server

    You've got an PvPGN server running on LAN and want to give your "buddies"
    a .reg file because cause it's this way easier for them to get onto your 
    server.
    
    Register your server on another machine with one of the gateway Gateway 
    Editors and export following keys to the reg-file:

    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Battle.net\Configuration]
    "Server List"
    "Diablo II Battle.net gateways" // for Diablo II
    "Battle.net gateways" // for Starcraft
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Battle.net\Configuration]
    "Server List"
    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Blizzard Entertainment\Warcraft III]
    "Battle.net gateways" // for War III
