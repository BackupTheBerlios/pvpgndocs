    It had to happen. We've got some bits and pieces of text that are too 
    important to loose, but dont' have a good place fro them in the main

Users can't see games created by others

    This is a reoccurring theme in the forums at http://forums.pvpgn.org 
    You need to fix this error yourself with some careful analysis and updating.

    First, ask some questions:
    Do you know specifically what version of the client software you are using?
    Do you know specifically what version of the client software your fellow game 
    players are using?

    My StarCraft experiences with PvPGN show that if the "GAME VERSION TAG"
    is not identical for all players then you can't see one anothers games. 
    (I'm sure it's versiontag).

    Depending on how the server is setup, it may or may not check versiontags. 
    Even if it is setup, but the admin running the PvPGN server has not 
    maintained the versioncheck.txt file then it is possible for you to connect 
    to the server and get a version tag that doesn't match everyone elses.

    OK, so you can't play on battlenet because of lag. I recommend you connect 
    to battle.net to at least verify that you are using the most up-to-date 
    version of the client software.

    If problems persist your PvPGN admin needs to update his versioncheck.txt file.

    examples... there are 4 x examples below, the last line is the versiontag 
    that is used inside the server. So you can connect and play with different 
    versions, but you must use matching software version to play games.

    It is posisble to cheat the system (under certain circumstances) and to 
    do that you must know the name of a game that has been created and key it 
    on your secrren (true for starcraft at least). Though it may not work in 
    all circumstances or for WarCraft.

PvPGN Development

   So you're interested in changing the PvPGN server code yourself? 
   Here's some tips....

   What if I want to compile this thing?
   Prepare to be shocked and amazed....
   a. download the source from sourceforge.net
   b. decompress the file into a directory on your machine
   c. READ and I mean READ the file 
       docs\Compile.Instructions.Win32.Borland.txt
       - yes I am assuming you are on Windows and don't have .NET compiler at hand
       - The instructions tell you that a FREE compiler is available from 
         ftp://ftpd.borland.com/download/bcppbuilder/freecommandLinetools.exe
       - Just read the rest of the instructions and follower the compiler install
         instruction to the letter. It's not complicated.
       - Once installed do a test compile (without changes). This will confirm your installation.

   *** How do I Help out on the PvPGN development?
    This section is more for my random collection of notes at this point.
    We'll see how it evolves.
    
    dizzy: README.DEV document if you go on the pvpgn development road
    
    The "latest" source code is available at:
    dizzy: If you do development you need to do it on current CVS (ie 1.7) not on 1.6 
    releases. for that you need to fetch the latest CVS 
    from sf.net: :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/pvpgn
    
    If you're new to this, search http://sourceforge.net for stuff about "CVS"
    and if you're on windows, look for a program called "wincvs". It's not the only
    CVS program for windows, I've provided the name here as a pointer for you.
    Sourceforge has a good write up about CVS and there are free PDF books available
    on the subject too.
    
    dizzy: If you want to contribute code back to the forums, please give use unified 
    diffs against latest CVS not whole files or part of files (its easier to 
    read them, check them, commit them). To get such a diff do something like this:
    cvs diff -u > /path/to/patchfile

    If you are in the root source directory of a checked out CVS source tree 
    it should output a unified diff into patchfile file.

    And your output looks like the file below c/- wincvs using the 
    Query/Diff selection menu option... (this shows code that I have added
    and is not in the current Sourceforge version)

   *** Can I edit a source file and compile so I can play Fastest Speed on Ladder on my server? 
   Quite possibly, see #11 below.   

   The maximum ladder speed is tied up with the client (i.e. your machine) 
   and Starcraft ruinning on it. In other words it's coded in Starcraft and 
   is difficult to influence at the server end.

   c/- http://forums.pvpng.org Comments and Suggestions, v1.7 Feature Requests 
   Response c/- dizzy
   I dont think this is server side setting. the client hardcodes the speed 
   of the ladder games AFAIK

   *** Not able to play ladder on "Fastest" speed? Can't find the 1.11b hack? 
    No problem, fix it server side.

    It's not a ladder game, but you can play One on One games and the results
    count towards the ladder.
    
    PitchWhite posted this patch on Jun 22 2004. It has been successfully applied
    again PvPGN 1.6.3
    
    
    Open... 

    /src/bnetd/game.c

    Find...

    CODE  
        if (realcount>=1 && !game->bad)
        {
           if (game_get_type(game)==game_type_ladder ||
               game_get_type(game)==game_type_ironman)
               {
                t_ladder_id id;
    
           if (game_get_type(game)==game_type_ladder)
               id = ladder_id_normal;
           else
               id = ladder_id_ironman; 

    Replace with

    CODE  
        if (realcount>=1 && !game->bad)
        {
           if (game_get_type(game)==game_type_ladder ||
               game_get_type(game)==game_type_ironman ||
               game_get_type(game)==game_type_oneonone)
              {
               t_ladder_id id;
    
           if (game_get_type(game)==game_type_ladder || 
               game_get_type(game)==game_type_oneonone)
                id = ladder_id_normal;
           else
                id = ladder_id_ironman; 

    Basically, One on One Gametypes now count as ladder. Do not worry about 
    computers, though, either. The server is programmed to give an error for 
    a game if there is no loser, which there wouldn't be in a 1v1 PvC game. 
    So no ladder points are recieved, nor is the game counted.

    Enjoy! 

main: failed to initialize network (exiting)
    When I look in my log file after starting PvPGN, it says 
    "main: failed to initialize network (exiting)". Make sure you edited the 
    bnetd.conf file correctly. Their are two possibilities as to what causes this:

   1. The servaddrs in the bnetd.conf is set incorrectly, make the servaddrs look like this:

          * servaddrs  =  "0.0.0.0:6112"
            This will tell PvPGN to listen on all IP addresses for port 6112. 

      or if you want PvPGN to listen only on a specific IP address, make the servaddrs look like this:

          * servaddrs  =  "X.X.X.X:6112"
            Replace X.X.X.X with your internet IP address.
            If your behind a router, replace X.X.X.X with your internal IP address. 


   2. The w3routeaddr in the bnetd.conf is set incorrectly, make the w3routeaddr look like this:

          * w3routeaddr  =  "X.X.X.X:6200"
            Replace X.X.X.X with your internet IP address.
            If your behind a router, replace X.X.X.X with your internal IP address. 



Example exert from the bnetd.conf file:
############################################################################# 	#
# Server network info 	#
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 	#
# Set this option to true to allow TCP to detect and close stale 	#

# interfaces. 	#
servaddrs  =  "26.135.61.243:6112" 	
# 	#
# Don't change these unless you really need to! You will need to run a proxy 	#

No realms are available right now
    When I log in using Diablo II, it says: "No realms are available right now. 
    Please try again later". This is typically caused when the IP address in the 
    realm.conf file is set incorrectly.

   1. Edit the realm.list file and change the IP address of the D2CS realm to the 
   IP address of the computer that is running the D2CS program:

          * X.X.X.X:6113
            Replace X.X.X.X with the IP address of the computer running D2CS. 
            This must be specific, 0.0.0.0:6113 won't work. 


            Then restart PvPGN and check your log files. If all went well, 
            it should look something like this:

Bot what?

    Try using "bnbot" included with the Linux and Mac versions of PvPGN
    Another good bot is prolix: http://prolix.sourceforge.net

    Also Stealth Bot, which all you do is point it to your server.
    www.stealthbot.net
