What is PvPGN?
    Is software that emulates the Blizzard battle.net server. 
    It gives you the power to run your own server, manage your own users, 
    run your own tournaments etc. 
    
    The PvPGN ( or Player versus Player Gaming Network ) is a bnetd based gaming 
    network server emulation project. It currently supports all Battle.Net clients,
    such as StarCraft + expansion, Diablo II, and Warcraft III + expansion.
    
    You can play games that are restricted to your local LAN or put your PvPGN 
    server on the Internet. It puts you as a "System Administrator" in control.
    Use a PvPGN server to host your own LAN parties or put the server online
    and on the internet for everyone. You can run Tournaments, have your own
    local competition ladders. The power is in your hands.
    
    PvPGN is a SourceForge project and can be accessed at
